    <div class="entry-content"><p>My name is Gary Ewan Park and I work as a Senior Software Systems Engineer up here in Aberdeen.  If you want to get in touch with me, there are a number of ways of doing that.  You can find me on <a href="http://twitter.com/gep13">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/people/Gary-Ewan-Park/671128676">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/gary-park/13/898/301">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gep13">Flickr</a>, and over at <a href="http://www.vbforums.com/member.php?u=53106">VB Forums</a>, or you can send a comment/question through this <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?page_id=38">blog</a>.</p>

<p>I first started coding at University, (well, I say coding but, what I mean of course is <a href="http://www.mathworks.co.uk/">MATLAB</a>), and at my first job I started using the wonderful VB6.  As time progressed, I moved onto VB.Net in Visual Studio 2003, and when I started using Visual Studio 2005 I made the switch to using C#.  This wasn’t because I didn’t “like” VB.Net, but as I started getting into Web Forms Development, I started seeing a lot of similarities in syntax between C# and JavaScript, and to me, it seemed to make more sense to use C#.  Now, I am happy to converse in either VB.Net or C#.  However, as I am always saying, it doesn&#8217;t matter about the syntax of the language, it is an understanding of the Framework, and what it is you are trying to achieve, that is the important thing.</p>

<p>I graduated from the University of Aberdeen with a First Class Honours Degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering.  Looking back at the career that I have had, it strikes me that a Computer Science Degree might have served me better.  On the other hand though, I do think it helps to be able to know about the hardware side of things, so that you can know what the software is trying to control.</p>

<p>Today sees me developing using SharePoint, Silverlight, and ASP.Net in Visual Studio 2008/2010.  In my spare time (what little I have) I am looking into using ASP.Net MVC, and the new version of my <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/">site</a> will use this (when I ever get round to finishing it).</p>

<p>My wife tells me that I am “always” on <a href="http://www.vbforums.com/member.php?u=53106">VB Forums</a>, but I like to think that this is a little bit of an exaggeration.  I have been a member over there since 2004, and in 2010 I was made the Moderator of the ASP.Net Forum.  I started out asking questions at the forum back when I was programming in VB6, but as time as progressed, I have found myself being able to attempt to answer more and more questions, so I like to try to help out where I can.  One thing that I would say is, don’t be fooled by the name of this Forum.  Although it’s roots are in VB6, it has a thriving community of .Net, Mobile, Web, Office, Games and Database Developers, so I would highly encourage you to come over and take a <a href="http://www.vbforums.com/index.php">look</a>.</p>

<p>Recently, I have also started reviewing technical articles for <a href="http://www.developerfusion.com/">developerFusion</a>.  I have a personal aim where I would also like to start writing technical articles myself, but due to time constants are other factors, I am not really in a position to do this just now.</p>

<p>For my sins, I am a self-confessed Microsoft Fan Boy.  I don’t know what else to say other than I think that the .Net Framework is a great platform to build on, and I really can’t get enough of it.  I am a certified Microsoft Developer, (you can see my certifications <a href="https://www.mcpvirtualbusinesscard.com/VBCServer/gep13/profile">here</a>) and I am more than happy to talk at length about anything geek related, so if you have any questions, feel free to get in touch.</p>

<p>Outside of work I like to play 5-a-side football and golf.  I used to be an archer at University as well, but since graduating I haven’t done any.  This is something that I would like to get back into though.</p>
