	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/nosql-autumn-conference-2010dundee/" itemprop="url">NoSql Autumn Conference 2010–Dundee</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Yesterday I attended the NoSql Autumn Conference at Dundee University:</p>

<p><a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/nosql1/">http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/nosql1/</a></p>

<p>This included talks on <a href="http://cassandra.apache.org/">Cassandra</a> (by Andy Cobley), <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a> (by Jonathan Forbes),<a href="http://ravendb.net/">RavenDB</a> (by Rob Ashton) and <a href="http://voltdb.com/">VoltDB</a> (by Mark Whitehorn), as well as an opening session entitled “Is NoSql the future of data storage?” by Gary Short.</p>

<p>In the past I have always used Sql Server, MySql and Oracle, I have never done anything with any NoSql Systems, but I went along to this conference with an open mind to see what else was available.</p>

<p>Of the systems that were talked about, the most interesting, from my point of view, was RavenDB. This is built on C#, and uses LINQ expressions to save and retrieve information from the data store, so from a .Net Development perspective, it certainly looked like the easiest system to get up and running with. The others required the use of Java, or Erlang, neither of which I have ever played with.</p>

<p>The only “slight” issue with RavenDB is that a lot of the features that make it stand out are currently still in the unstable branch of the development. However, as the speaker, Rob, pointed out, by the time you are ready to roll out a system that uses these features, it is more than likely that these features will have been moved over to the stable branch as there is a high level of active development going on.</p>

<p>From a NoSql point of view, the concepts of Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance, (CAP) are at the heart of each system, but no one system can have each of these. They can have 2 out of the 3 only. So for instance, standard systems like SQL Server are CA, Hadoop is CP and RavenDB is AP.</p>

<p>Gary Short pretty much summed up the NoSql movement when he answered the question “Is NoSql the future of data storage?” by saying Yes, and No.</p>

<p>The concepts at the heart of NoSql make it very appealing when it comes to distributed storage and horizontal scalability, but it won’t be long before the big database manufacturers start to implement some of these concepts natively into their systems.</p>

 	</div> 

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/microsoft-app-hub-registration/" itemprop="url">Microsoft App Hub Registration</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Having got the new <a href="http://www.htc.com/uk/product/hd7/overview.html">HTC HD7</a> a couple weeks ago, I decided that I wanted to create an account with the <a href="http://create.msdn.com/">App Hub</a>. Doing so means that I can unlock the handset and make it a developer handset.</p>

<p>What this means is that applications that have been created within Visual Studio can be deployed directly to the device. Until this is done, the only way to get applications onto a handset is to download them directly from the Microsoft Marketplace.</p>

<p>Although there is an emulator within the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=04704acf-a63a-4f97-952c-8b51b34b00ce&amp;displaylang=en">Windows Phone Developer Tools</a> which allows you to debug and test applications, there are times when you simply “have” to deploy to a physical device. One of the main reasons is to get a true representation of the performance of your application. Running through the emulator on a powerful machine can give a “false” indication of the performance of the application.</p>

<p>There are a set of very specific criteria that any application you create has to abide by and before submitting our application to the Marketplace for testing you will need to verify that your application meets them.</p>

<p>App Hub registration costs £65 + VAT per year.</p>

<p>There are a number of steps that have to be completed before you can get to the stage of unlocking your handset.</p>

<p><strong><em>Step 1: Create an App Hub Account</em></strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Microsoft-App-Hub-Registration_13804/b420594f-c8cd-4c60-ba5a-54edfd9e77e3.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Microsoft-App-Hub-Registration_13804/b420594f-c8cd-4c60-ba5a-54edfd9e77e3_thumb.png" alt="b420594f-c8cd-4c60-ba5a-54edfd9e77e3" /></a></p>

<p>This will require a Windows Live ID. (If you don’ t have one, you can register <a href="https://signup.live.com/signup.aspx?lic=1">here</a>.) Go to the App Hub website and sign in.</p>

<p>If you have any problems signing into the App Hub site, first try going to the <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/live">XBox Live</a>site and signing in there. There was a known issue with the Terms and Conditions on the XBox Live site which meant you had to first accept their Terms and Conditions before being able to progress with the App Hub registration.</p>

<p>During the registration process, you will be asked whether you want to register a individual account, a Business account, or a student account. You may want to spend some time thinking about this one as once you have made the decision, you can’t change it, and you will need to create a new account with a different Windows Live ID.</p>

<p><strong><em>Step 2: Verify Email Address</em></strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Microsoft-App-Hub-Registration_13804/4c2e6ba3-be55-48a0-b64b-b11d9d4f8f5a.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Microsoft-App-Hub-Registration_13804/4c2e6ba3-be55-48a0-b64b-b11d9d4f8f5a_thumb.png" alt="4c2e6ba3-be55-48a0-b64b-b11d9d4f8f5a" /></a></p>

<p>Once you have completed Step 1, you will need to verify your email address. This can simply be achieved by clicking on the link that you will receive to the email address that you used to sign up.</p>

<p><strong><em>Step 3: GeoTrust Verification</em></strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Microsoft-App-Hub-Registration_13804/7eed2713-7369-418a-9634-2645883e8cb3.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Microsoft-App-Hub-Registration_13804/7eed2713-7369-418a-9634-2645883e8cb3_thumb.png" alt="7eed2713-7369-418a-9634-2645883e8cb3" /></a></p>

<p>The next step in the authorisation process is handed over to a Microsoft Partner called GeoTrust. This involves having to submit a photocopy/scan of a piece of photographic identification. For instance, your driving license or passport. You will be asked for this by email. This step in the process can take upwards of a few days to complete.</p>

<p><strong><em>Step 4: Unlock Phone</em></strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Microsoft-App-Hub-Registration_13804/281e82ed-9a0b-4fba-955c-d1c64663dad8.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Microsoft-App-Hub-Registration_13804/281e82ed-9a0b-4fba-955c-d1c64663dad8_thumb.png" alt="281e82ed-9a0b-4fba-955c-d1c64663dad8" /></a></p>

<p>Once GeoTrust has verified your identity you will be able to unlock your handset. (You can unlock up to 3 devices, and once unlocked you can control which devices you want to keep unlocked through your App Hub account). This step is completed by using the Windows Phone Developer Registration Tool which was installed along with the Windows Phone Developer Tools.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Microsoft-App-Hub-Registration_13804/586379f6-5f9b-4189-96db-dbaa610054cb.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Microsoft-App-Hub-Registration_13804/586379f6-5f9b-4189-96db-dbaa610054cb_thumb.png" alt="586379f6-5f9b-4189-96db-dbaa610054cb" /></a></p>

<p>However, before you will be able to connect your phone to your computer, you will have to install the <a href="http://www.zune.net/en-GB/">Zune</a> software so that your computer can communicate with the handset.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Microsoft-App-Hub-Registration_13804/df79e327-4cb3-4070-80e3-5467ba1bceb3.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Microsoft-App-Hub-Registration_13804/df79e327-4cb3-4070-80e3-5467ba1bceb3_thumb.png" alt="df79e327-4cb3-4070-80e3-5467ba1bceb3" /></a></p>

<p>Once installed, connect your handset to your computer via the USB cable, and allow the device drivers to install. Then open the developer registration tool. Make sure that your phone is switched on and open (i.e. you can see the live tiles) and then type in your Windows Live ID and password, and click Register.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Microsoft-App-Hub-Registration_13804/035af53b-cf02-4896-a835-a4c468aa2eda.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Microsoft-App-Hub-Registration_13804/035af53b-cf02-4896-a835-a4c468aa2eda_thumb.png" alt="035af53b-cf02-4896-a835-a4c468aa2eda" /></a></p>

<p><strong><em>Step 5: Verify Handset is unlocked</em></strong></p>

<p>Log into your App Hub account and go to your Windows Phone Dashboard, and click “Manage your development phones”. Here you should see the phone that you just registered.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Microsoft-App-Hub-Registration_13804/fae30ad8-d26c-4979-99bb-69f40d55cca7.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Microsoft-App-Hub-Registration_13804/fae30ad8-d26c-4979-99bb-69f40d55cca7_thumb.png" alt="fae30ad8-d26c-4979-99bb-69f40d55cca7" /></a></p>

<p>With this step completed, you will now be able to choose this option:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Microsoft-App-Hub-Registration_13804/d4453484-4c92-4033-9a52-2bed1b168765.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Microsoft-App-Hub-Registration_13804/d4453484-4c92-4033-9a52-2bed1b168765_thumb.png" alt="d4453484-4c92-4033-9a52-2bed1b168765" /></a></p>

<p>Within Visual Studio to deploy applications onto your handset.</p>

<p><strong><em>Points to note</em></strong></p>

<p>During the registration process, I received an email saying that my payment had been cancelled, however, I never cancelled it. It this happens to you, the best people to contact are the XBox Live team, as they deal with the subscription payment. You can find their contact details here:</p>

<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-GB/pages/contact-us.aspx">http://support.xbox.com/en-GB/pages/contact-us.aspx</a></p>

<p>I found their team to be very helpful, and I was quickly able to get everything straightened out.</p>

<p>You are able to upload up to 5 free applications to the Marketplace, and any number of paid for applications. However, in order to get any revenue from the Marketplace, you will have to sort out the Tax implications. I haven’t yet completed this step, but once I have figured it out, I will let you know how to do it.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/lloyds-tsb-scam-email/" itemprop="url">Lloyds TSB Scam Email</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>In the last two weeks, I have had two emails claiming to be from my Lloyds TSB online account. In them, they tell me that due to “suspicious” activity on my online account (log ins from multiple IP addresses) my account has been temporarily limited, and I need to take one of two courses of action:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Click on the provided link to log into my account and re-enable it.</p></li>
<li><p> Complete the attachment</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Now, both of the above things made me a little suspicious, but looking at the email closer, there were a few tell tale signs that this was a scam email, and that it should be deleted and not looked at.</p>

<p>Firstly, the “from” address of the email:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Lloyds-TSB-scam-email_13AAA/14a5ab8f-17fc-46c1-b602-f154010be53e.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Lloyds-TSB-scam-email_13AAA/14a5ab8f-17fc-46c1-b602-f154010be53e_thumb.png" alt="14a5ab8f-17fc-46c1-b602-f154010be53e" /></a></p>

<p>You should notice a couple things from the above:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> It is from “Loyds TSB”. This is a spelling mistake, and would unlikely happen on a legitimate email.</p></li>
<li><p> The registered domain name is also incorrect @loydstsb.com</p></li>
<li><p> The user name for the email is “supporti”. Again, this is unlikely in a legitimate email.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Looking in to the body of the email, I was then presented with:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Lloyds-TSB-scam-email_13AAA/ddff2199-f268-4526-a477-59ca19a25bdb.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Lloyds-TSB-scam-email_13AAA/ddff2199-f268-4526-a477-59ca19a25bdb_thumb.png" alt="ddff2199-f268-4526-a477-59ca19a25bdb" /></a></p>

<p>Notice here that the URL for the link goes to lloydstsb.co.uk. Although the spelling of Lloyds is correct this time, the actual URL for my Lloyds TSB account goes to lloydstsb.com. A subtle difference, but in the world of the internet, this is the difference between a legitimate site, and a bogus one.</p>

<p>Bottom line is, if you receive any emails like this, ALWAYS err on the side of caution. Don’t click any direct links from these emails, and don’t open any attachments. If in any doubt, phone your bank, or whoever is the subject of the email, they will be able to help you</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Today, I was hoping to bring you a blow by blow account of my new Windows Phone 7 handset, the HTC HD7. I ordered it on Thursday, and I was told that I would have it yesterday. When I checked the DHL tracking website, sure enough, it said it was “Out of delivery” as of 15:23 yesterday. However, it never arrived, and there has been no update on the DHL website.</p>

<p>I phoned O2 this morning, and they were able to get in touch with DHL directly. Now, you would think that “Out for Delivery” means just that, it is out for delivery, however, that would be too easy. All this means is that it is in the hands of the courier who is going to deliver it, and it will be delivered at some point in the future. DHL, you really need to update your website with sensible descriptions!!! I have now been told that the phone will be delivered on Monday, however, there is not going to be anyone in the house on Monday, and much to my dismay, you can’t change the delivery address until they attempt delivery at least once, and neither am I able to pick it up from the depot. At the earliest, I am not going to have the phone until Tuesday <img src="http://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=46e7fb82-88ca-4efc-a766-c20a5dabb70a" alt="Sad smile" /></p>

<p>Boo!!!!</p>

		<p>Just found out about the existence of this pack, so I thought I would share:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Microsoft-Windows-Premium-Upgrade-customer/dp/B002MT21N6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=software&amp;qid=1286280895&amp;sr=8-1">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Microsoft-Windows-Premium-Upgrade-customer/dp/B002MT21N6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=software&amp;qid=1286280895&amp;sr=8-1</a></p>

<p>Seems like a good deal if you have more than one computer in the house that you want to have running Windows 7.</p>

		<p>For a long time, I have been an avid user of logmein, and I love it!!</p>

<p><a href="https://secure.logmein.com/">https://secure.logmein.com/</a></p>

<p>I have all my friends and families machines connected to my free account which means if anyone is having any problems with their computer, and they are connected to the internet, then I can jump onto their machine, see what is going on, and take control if I need to, to fix the problem.</p>

<p>There are paid for versions of logmein available, that extend the feature set, such as File Share, Remote to Local Audio, etc, however, I have never felt the need for those versions.</p>

<p>There have been times though when I have been asked for help from people who are not connected to my logmein account, meaning that I can’t jump on and look at their machine. Although they try, some of the descriptions that I get from people (It’s not working…) makes it impossible to know what is going on, and it is just easier to be able to see their screen. There are ways to remotely connect computers to my logmein account, however, it isn’t a particularly simple process.</p>

<p>That is where <a href="http://showmewhatswrong.com/">ShowMeWhatsWrong.com</a> steps in. Basically, it allows the user (me) to send a url to the person at the other end of the phone, and on clicking that link, they will be taken to a website that will start recording their screen, thus allowing them to show me what the problem is. Once completed, the video file is then sent to me in an email for me to take a look at.</p>

<p>Everything is described in the video below:</p>

<p>Enjoy!!</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/upcoming-net-user-group-meeting/" itemprop="url">Upcoming .Net User Group Meeting</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>At last nights .Net User Group Meeting, I announced details of our upcoming meeting in November, so I thought I would follow up with additional details here.</p>

<p>Basically, we are lucky enough to have 2 Microsoft gurus coming up to Aberdeen to do a talk on Silverlight, both on the desktop and on the mobile platform.</p>

<p>The Microsoft gurus that I am referring to are:</p>

<p>Mike Taulty - <a href="http://mtaulty.com/communityserver/blogs/mike_taultys_blog/default.aspx">http://mtaulty.com/communityserver/blogs/mike_taultys_blog/default.aspx</a></p>

<p>and</p>

<p>Mike Ormond - <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/mikeormond/">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/mikeormond/</a></p>

<p>I am still waiting on complete details of exactly what is going to be in the talks, but I will upload more information about the talk here:</p>

<p><a href="http://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Meetings/What-s-New-in-Silverlight-4-.aspx">http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Meetings/What-s-New-in-Silverlight-4-.aspx</a></p>

<p>As it becomes available.</p>

<p>What I can say is that this meeting will be starting earlier than our previous meetings. This is to allow for the fact that we will be having two sessions. Both sessions will likely be about an hour in length with a break in between the two sessions.</p>

<p>In addition, due to the expected number of attendees at the event, it is likely that we will not be able to use Room A4 in the RGU building as we have been. Instead, we should be able to use one of the larger auditoriums in the RGU Building. These details will be confirmed as we get closer to the meeting date.</p>

<p>I would encourage everyone to spread the word about this event, and try to get as many people to attend as possible. If we can get a good turn out at this event, then it will show Microsoft that we have a substantial community in this area, and will hopefully open the doors to holding more of these events in the future.</p>
