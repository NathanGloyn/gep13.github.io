	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/update-7-10-7710-68-for-windows-phone-7-wp7/" itemprop="url">Update 7.10.7720.68 for Windows Phone 7 (#WP7)</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>With one thing and another (mainly work), I have not been keeping up with news about my beloved HTC HD7, running Windows Phone 7.  So last Friday when a message popped up on my phone to say that there was an update available for it, I was a bit surprised.  I turned to Twitter to ask a question about what the update was for (ok, I was being lazy), and the answer that I got back was it was a <a href="http://www.winrumors.com/microsoft-rolling-out-windows-phone-update-to-fix-exchange-and-voicemail-bugs/">bug fix release for Exchange and Voicemail</a>.</p>

<p>Nothing in the information that I then read about made me want to run away and install it there and then, so I decided to leave it until I had more time.</p>

<p>The next day came and I saw this tweet from ShawnWildermuth:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ShawnWildermuth/status/137623103256793088"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/image1.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>I couldn’t quite believe what I was reading!  This was the killer function that I have been waiting for!  Ever since switching to Windows Phone 7 from my Windows Mobile 6.5 I have sorely missed the ability to fire up the internet on my laptop while on the move.  A quick conversation exchange with Shawn pointed me <a href="http://www.wpcentral.com/updates-out-htc-hd7-mozart-and-samsung-focus-bringing-tethering-many">here</a>, and I set about starting the update!</p>

<p>The good news?  I can now tether my laptop to the internet via my Windows Phone 7!! <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/wlEmoticon-smile1.png" alt="Smile" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMAG0354.jpg"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMAG0354_thumb.jpg" alt="IMAG0354" /></a></p>

<p>With the update installed, you will see a new “Internet Sharing” option in the Settings window.  Then all that is left to do is to enable it.  With that done, you will have the option to connect up to 5 devices to the internet via your handset.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMAG0352.jpg"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMAG0352_thumb.jpg" alt="IMAG0352" /></a></p>

<p>The only thing that worries me now is the reports that I have been hearing on the news about unlimited data contracts, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2011/nov/22/mobile-web-users-unlimited-data-caps">not actually being unlimited</a>.  Before I start using this service heavily I am going to check with my service provider that I actually do have an unlimited data contract, and I would strongly advice that you do the same before using this service, as the last thing that you are going to want is a hefty mobile phone bill at the end of the month.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/a-review-of-dunddd/" itemprop="url">A Review of #DunDDD</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>The <a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/home/">DDD</a> series of conferences in the UK is growing!  Firstly, with a new conference in Sunderland called <a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/north/">DDDNorth</a>.  Unfortunately, I was not able to attend that one this year, however, I was able to attend the other new conference; namely <a href="http://dundee.dddscotland.co.uk/">DunDDD</a>.</p>

<h2>DunDDD</h2>

<p>Brought to you by the people who organised the <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=99">NoSQL Autumn Conference</a> in Dundee last year and <a href="http://scottishdevelopers.com/">Scottish Developers</a>, this event was a three track event, with five sessions spread over the course of the day.  The first track was dedicated to “NoSQL”, the second was “The Web” and the third was a general track.</p>

<p>At the start of the day, Colin MacKay asked if I would manage to help out as a room monitor which I agreed to, which resulted in me spending most of the day in the General Track, however, the majority of the sessions that I wanted to see were in this track, so that worked out quite well.</p>

<h2>Session 1</h2>

<p><a href="http://dddscotland.co.uk/lineup/speaker/11">Data Mining The Social Web</a> – Gary Short (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/garyshort">@garyshort</a>)</p>

<p>First up, I decided to attend Gary Short’s session.  I have had the opportunity to see this talk on a number of occasions, at a few different conferences, but due to clashes with other sessions that I also wanted to see, I have never been able to attend.  I thought it was about time that I fixed that, and I am happy to say that I was not disappointed.</p>

<p>Gary presented a very clear picture of how analysing information from Social Media sites such as Twitter and Facebook, can provide some very useful and pertinent information for marketing purposes within your business.</p>

<p>For instance, you can use data analysis techniques to find out information like:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>_“When Do My Customers Talk About Me?” _</p></li>
<li><p>_“How Fast Do They Start To Talk About Me?” _</p></li>
<li><p>_“What’s My Share of The Buzz?” _</p></li>
<li><p>_“When Is The Busiest Hour&#8221;?” _</p></li>
<li><p>_“What Words Do They Use?” _</p></li>
<li><p>_“Who Are The Influencers” _</p></li>
<li><p>_“Most ReTweets” _</p></li>
<li><p><em>“What is The Lexical Diversity?”</em></p></li>
</ul>


<p>With this information at hand, companies can then decide on a social marketing campaign to make decisions about when is the best time to make a tweet about your product and also which words to use.  Unfortunately, Gary ran a little short of time and was not able to show the sample code that he uses to produce the analyses.  I am hoping that Gary will make this information available, and if he does, I will link back to it from here.</p>

<h2>Session 2</h2>

<p><a href="http://dddscotland.co.uk/lineup/speaker/4">The Philosophy of Unix</a> – Craig Nicol (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/craignicol">@craignicol</a>)</p>

<p>There was a slight change of title for this presentation before it kicked off.  It was changed to:</p>

<p>“The Philosophy of Code”</p>

<p>This was actually a very well put together presentation!  Using a number of quotes from various people throughout history (you can see a full list of quotes below) Craig was able to establish some “rules” that can be applied to your day to day development work.</p>

<p>The one thing that I would say is, this presentation could do with some “polish”.  After speaking afterwards, this was the first time that Craig had done this talk, and with some additional practice I think this could turn into a fantastic session that is a must see!</p>

<h2>Session 3</h2>

<p><a href="http://dddscotland.co.uk/lineup/speaker/5">“The Happy Developer” – Is It a Myth?</a> – Andy Gibson (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ARGibson">@ARGibson</a>)</p>

<p>This session led on very nicely from Craig’s session and attempted to answer the eternal question… “<em>What makes a happy developer?</em>”  It is reasonably simply to answer the opposite question, “<em>What makes a developer unhappy?</em>”, in fact, Andy asked this question to the members of the audience, and this is what we came up with:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Have to work on Sundays</p></li>
<li><p>When you ship crap</p></li>
<li><p>Bad specifications</p></li>
<li><p>No specifications</p></li>
<li><p>No change controls</p></li>
<li><p>When Managers don’t respect your schedule</p></li>
</ul>


<p>However, what makes us happy?  This lead into a reasonably heated discussion into whether it is our environment, our co-workers, our equipment, our responsibilities, or a combination of all these things that make us happy in our job.  This was the third time that Andy has given this presentation, and you can see how the talk is maturing, and I am sure that there will be some take away points from this conference that will make it into his next presentation.
During the talk, Andy also asked another question, “<em>What does a developer in 2011 need?</em>”, this is what the room came up with:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Peace</p></li>
<li><p>At least two large monitors</p></li>
<li><p>A desk with drawers</p></li>
<li><p>No phones (distraction)</p></li>
<li><p>Comfortable chair</p></li>
<li><p>Donuts</p></li>
<li><p>Program Specification</p></li>
<li><p>Good Development Tools</p></li>
<li><p>Testers</p></li>
<li><p>Creative Outlet</p></li>
<li><p>Problem solving tools (whiteboards, post it notes, etc.)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>For me, a couple of take away points were:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Record your estimates.  Even if you don’t have a formal process, record them for your own records.  That way, when you have to estimate something else, you can look at this estimate, compare it against how long it actually took, and that way you will make a better estimate.</p></li>
<li><p>What it boils down to is… Respect.  Respect is earned in both directions. Much the same as trust.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Lunch and Grok Talks</h2>

<p>Hmmm…. Pizza!! This was kindly donated by NCR (one of the sponsors of DunDDD).  Although the agenda mentioned that there would be some Grok Talks, I ended up in a conversation with <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/camurphy">@CAMURPHY</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/argibson">@ARGibson</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/leggetter">@leggetter</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/craignicol">@craignicol</a>, so I couldn’t actually tell you if there were any Grok Talks.  It was a very interesting conversation though <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" /></p>

<h2>Session 4</h2>

<p>Open Discussion on Software Requirements – Craig Murphy and Craig Nicol (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/camurphy">@CAMURPHY</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/craignicol">@craignicol</a>)</p>

<p>What Makes Good Requirements?  This was the question that the two Craig’s (they reminded me of the two Ronnie’s) were trying to answer in this open discussion.  The reason for this discussion was that Craig Murphy is actually going to be doing a talk at the <a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/">Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group</a> in December, and this session was to act as Market Research to find out what sort of problems other people have run into when trying to establish requirements for a project.</p>

<p>This was a very lively session, with lots of good discussion.  There were not a lot of people in attendance, but I think that helped the flow of the conversation, and the end result was a lot of food for thought!  I am now very interested to hear Craig’s session in December.</p>

<p>During the presentation Craig Nicol was creating an XMind Document of all the points, which you can find on his <a href="http://craignicol.wordpress.com/2011/11/20/slides-and-mind-maps-for-dunddd/">blog</a>, so if you are interested, you can go and grab it.</p>

<h2>Session 5</h2>

<p><a href="http://dddscotland.co.uk/lineup/speaker/6">Jedi Mind Control 101</a> – Rob Lally (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/roblally">@roblally</a>)</p>

<p>I had never had the opportunity to see Rob do a presentation before today, but I have to say that I was very impressed.  He is a great speaker, and the subject matter did drive home a few important points about when you are interacting with colleagues, managers etc.</p>

<p>Although the title seems a bit cryptic, this session is well worth attending, and I would thoroughly recommend attending if it comes up at another conference.</p>

<p>For me, some of the take away points were as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In terms of trying to interact with your colleagues and managers, bottom line is, “<em>Nothing works if you’re a ^*”£%$</em>”.  This seems fairly obvious, but it is also something that is easy forgotten in the middle of a discussion/argument.</p></li>
<li><p>Within your team, you need to get into a cycle of positive feedback, and not negative feedback.</p></li>
<li><p>“<em>Teams gel when they lose track of favours</em>” – better when everyone (either across a single team, or across teams within a company) is just willing to help each other out.</p></li>
<li><p><em>“Do Not Diminish Your Efforts”</em>.  Don’t say things like:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>All part of the job</p></li>
<li><p>No problem</p></li>
<li><p>It was nothing</p></li>
<li><p>It was easy</p></li>
<li><p>It was nothing</p></li>
<li><p>It was easy</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Instead, make it clear that you have helped the person and here are the reasons why, but also don&rsquo;t rub it in their face. Be concrete about what effort was expended, and verbalise that a favour was done.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>P.S. Sorry for messing up the timing queues at the end of your session Rob, don’t know what happened there.  All I can say was it had been a long day! <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" /></p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>With the run up to Christmas I keep getting asked the same question…</p>

<p>What do you want for Christmas?</p>

<p>The typical answer that I give to this question is, “I don’t know, just get me vouchers”. I normally say Amazon vouchers, that way, when something does crop up that I quite fancy, nine times of out ten, Amazon, or an Amazon reseller will have it, and I just order it up.</p>

<p>There are a couple things that I have been thinking about purchasing lately, and some vouchers towards them would help out.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001V7RF9U/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B001V7RF9U"><img src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.co.uk/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;Format=_SL110_&amp;ASIN=B001V7RF9U&amp;MarketPlace=GB&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822" alt="" /></a>The first is <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001V7RF9U/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B001V7RF9U">LEGO Mindstorms.</a> I have always been a big fan of LEGO, and I had a ton of LEGO Technic and LEGO Pirates when I was growing up, but there is something very appealing about the ability to control the “thing” that you create using the 32-bit microprocessor that comes with it. I have thought about getting this for a long time now, but never have, so I am thinking that this Christmas could be as good a time as any.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B004FRZ4E6/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B004FRZ4E6"><img src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.co.uk/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;Format=_SL110_&amp;ASIN=B004FRZ4E6&amp;MarketPlace=GB&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822" alt="" /></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=www6thprimeco-21&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B004FRZ4E6" alt="" /></p>

<p>The second thing that I am thinking about is a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B004FRZ4E6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B004FRZ4E6">Netduino</a> board. I have absolutely no idea what I would actually create if I were to get one of these, but again, I just love the idea of being able to control “stuff” via the programs that I create. If I do end of getting one of these, I guess I should pick up the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1449302459/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=1449302459">Getting Started</a> book that goes along with it, that may I am less likely to blow things up!</p>

<p>What other geek related things are out there that could be a good shout for folks to get me for Christmas, or for me to buy for myself? I guess I am looking for something hardware related, not software.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<h2>It was a great event!</h2>

<p>Now that the dust has settled, and everyone has returned home after GiveCamp UK, I thought it was time to reflect on the weekend.  Was it good?  Was it bad?  What could be done better?</p>

<p>Bottom line, I thought it was an amazing event, and from a personal stand point, I got a lot out of the event, and I would happily take part in future events like this.</p>

<p>The first thing I have to say is a tremendous well done, and thank you, to all of the organisers of this event.  They really did an amazing job and they should be very proud of themselves.  Congratulations to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/stack72">Paul Stack</a>, and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/rachelhawley">Rachel Hawley</a>!!</p>

<p>What follows is how the weekend of GiveCamp UK broke down for me, and the members of <a href="http://theyoucanhub.org.uk/">TheYouCanHub</a> charity team.</p>

<h2>Friday, 21st October 2011</h2>

<p>My intention was to get into London reasonably early on Friday afternoon so that I could help Paul with anything that needed doing, and since I was travelling from Nottingham, I thought that this would be reasonably easy to achieve.  However, due to a problem with getting a taxi sorted out, I missed my train, and had to wait for the next one!</p>

<p>Anyway, after arriving in London and checking into my hotel, the next problem was finding the UCL venue.  Although located in a great place, I haven’t been to London very often, and finding my way around, is still a bit of a problem.  Help was at hand in the form of a tweet from <a href="http://www.twitter.com/davesussman">Dave Sussman</a> which directed me straight to the North Cloisters building of UCL.  Thanks Dave!</p>

<p>Not long after, Paul arrived with his car jam-packed full of crisps, juice and various other snacks, which was to be the staple diet of the eager programmers over the weekend.  With that unloaded, Paul asked if I could help him with another run to the cash and carry to pick up even more food!!</p>

<p>What happened next I hear you ask?  Well, we spend the next 3 hours travelling the 24 miles to the cash and carry!!  This was the first time that I had properly experienced London traffic, and it is not something that I am keen to do again!</p>

<p>As a result, we both missed the start of the GiveCamp UK introductions, but thankfully Rachel stepped up and got everyone organised, and we kept up with what was going on through the #GiveCampUK hash tag.  En route back, Paul gave me a quick overview of the Charities that were going to be attending the event, and what sort of projects they were looking to get completed.  On arrival back to UCL I set about starting to find a team that I could join.  People were already starting to naturally fall into groups and having not been there since the start, I did feel a little bit like an outsider, however, I then met up with Daniel Elliott (Team Lead) and Phil Jones, who were going to be working on <a href="http://theyoucanhub.org.uk/">TheYouCanHub</a> team, so I decided to join them.</p>

<p>With the team fully formed, we set about having a quick chat with Mel and Lou from <a href="http://theyoucanhub.org.uk/">TheYouCanHub</a>.  The were not able to make it in person, but we were able to chat to them on Skype.  They already had a very clear idea about what they wanted to achieve, and had detailed everything in a number of documents which they were able to send to us.  We essentially had a full set of requirements!</p>

<p>Their brief broke down quite simply…</p>

<p>Take their existing WordPress site, and make it better!  They had already identified a number of other websites which they liked, and we were able to take a lot of ideas from them, and make a decision about how we were going to proceed.</p>

<p>Now, some of you out there might be thinking “<em><strong>a WordPress site… Really? Where is the coding?</strong></em>” And I will be honest, for a while there, I was thinking the same.  However, at the end of the day, WordPress does what it does very well, and Mel and Lou wanted to use something that they were familiar with, so there was no point in trying to roll out a custom system so that we could actually cut some code.</p>

<p>The rest of the evening was used to plan out what we were going to do over the next day and a half, as well as searching through the extensive array of WordPress Plugins and Themes to see what we could make use of.</p>

<p>As I left UCL to head back from the hotel there were still a number of teams busy working hard, and I have to say that I did feel a little bit guilty leaving, however, we had done everything that was required for this evening, and we all thought that it would be best to get an early’ish night, ready for a full day tomorrow.</p>

<h2>Saturday, 22nd October 2011</h2>

<p>Woke up at 0700 and headed down to UCL.  By 0830 all the team members had arrived apart from one.  We were a man down!  Never mind though, we soldiered on, and we were committed to getting the job done.</p>

<p>The first real order of business was to get a WordPress site up and running so that we could begin testing and configuring the site in the way that was required.  This started out as everyone installing their own copy of WordPress on their laptops (which can be easily achieved using the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/web/downloads/platform.aspx">Microsoft Web Platform Installer</a>).  However, it quickly became apparent that this wasn’t going to work out.  Every time something was done on one machine, it would need to be done on another machine to test it.</p>

<p>We started to have a play with Heroku and AppHarbor (which Paul had organised to be used by the teams) but no one on the team had used these before, so rather than waste time trying to get it up and running, I set up a quick sub-domain on my own hosting provider, and got WordPress up and running.</p>

<p>With that in place we were able to work on one environment, and include everyone’s additions at the same time.  This did introduce it’s own problems, with a couple of people editing the same files at the same time, but once some processes had been put in place, this wasn’t an issue.</p>

<p>After a couple of hours, we “thought” we had something that quite closely resembled what the charity wanted, and really what was required next was confirmation of what they wanted, so that we could begin the “tidy-up” phase.</p>

<p>Mel and Lou from <a href="http://theyoucanhub.org.uk/">TheYouCanHub</a> arrived around lunch time, and we sat down and had a chat about what we had achieved.  Although they liked what we had done so far, it was clear that we had missed one crucial requirement, and it was time to go back to the drawing board.  I sat down and had a lengthy chat with Lou and was able to stub out exactly what they were trying to achieve.  With that in place, it was time to, literally, start again.</p>

<p>At this point, rather than continue with the WordPress site I had hosted on my hosting provider (<strong><em>SHAMELESS PLUG ALERT</em></strong>: They are called <a href="http://tracking.blacknight.com/aff_c?offer_id=5&amp;aff_id=37">Blacknight</a>, and offer a great service!) we checked to see whether we could start to use their “live” WordPress site.  We got an agreement to do this, so we set to work, with the first order of action to find a WordPress Plugin to do a complete back up of the entire site, including the database, in case things went wrong!</p>

<p>Due to the fact that I had got a grasp of the requirements from Lou, I was given the responsibility of issuing tasks to the Team members, which I “think” I did an alright job of.  This change in direction saw us retiring the WordPress theme that we had identified as being a close fit, and instead re-writing a new custom template from scratch.  Dibs have to go to the two Phil’s for bringing this all together!</p>

<p>We ended up working far later than we thought we were going to have to, as we actually thought we were going to be finished early, but never mind.  Again, it was back to the hotel for a few hours sleep before getting up early again.</p>

<h2>Sunday, 23rd October 2011</h2>

<p>Woke up at 0700 and headed down to UCL.  Again, the entire team was there quite early, and we set about putting the finishing touches to the site.  The site really started to come together once we had some images to put on it.  Mel did an amazing job of communicating all of this to us via email, and very quickly the site started to look complete.  “<em>Lorem ipsum</em>” placeholders started to be replaced by actual content, and we could see the site coming together in front of us.</p>

<p>Sooner than expected, 12:00 came round, and we had to down tools, and make sure that everything was finished up, and that everything was checked into Source Control.  For us, that meant taking a full backup of the web server directory and database backup and pushing this up to GitHub.  With that done, and laptops packed away, it was a case of tidying up and the North Cloisters area of UCL, and then heading outside to chill out in the sunshine and to enjoy some of the amazing hog roast that had been cooking outside since the small hours.  It was very yummy! All around there were smiling faces, and although everyone was very tired, it was clear to see that everyone had a great time!</p>

<p>At 1500 we moved to a lecture theatre where we got presentations from each of the teams regarding what they had created over the course of the weekend.  For our team, check out the following <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22E7oTzP1Os">video</a> which shows Daniel giving an interpretive dance!  I am very proud of the fact that we were actually able to demo the live site at the presentation.</p>

<p>It really was great to see what everyone had achieved, and several of the charities were represented at the presentations and it was amazing to see and hear their reactions to what they were going to be receiving.  It really did make it all worthwhile.</p>

<p>Following the presentations, there was a swag giveaway (with prizes totalling over £30,000).  Everyone who attended GiveCamp UK was given an 80GB SSD Hard Drive, which Paul had kept as an extra special surprise for the attendees.</p>

<p>After that, with the crowd starting to thin out, Paul and Lorraine gave me a lift to London Heathrow for my plane back up to Aberdeen.  Thanks again for the lift!</p>

<h2>What happens next?</h2>

<p>You may be wondering what happens to the Charities, now that they have received everything from the teams?  What happens when something goes wrong, or they need something else done to it?  I can’t speak for the rest of the teams, but we have agreed to make available a couple of hours a month of our own time to help out with anything that they need.</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<p>I wanted to say a personal thanks to all the members of <a href="http://theyoucanhub.org.uk/">TheYouCanHub</a> GiveCamp UK team.  It really was a pleasure meeting with you and working on this project.  You can see us pictured below courtesy of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bertcraven/">Bert Craven</a>.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>It is hard to believe, but <a href="http://www.givecamp.org.uk/">GiveCamp UK</a> is now only a four days away. If you haven’t seen it already, the list of Charities and Projects that are going to be involved can be found <a href="http://www.givecamp.org.uk/blog/introducing-our-givecamp-uk-2011-charity-projects">here</a>. I am really looking forward to finding out what Project I am going to be working on, and how I am going to be able to help out!!</p>

<p>With the day fast approaching, it is making me wonder whether I have everything that I need installed on my laptop. So I thought I would create a list of the applications that I think I am going to need, and currently have installed. Then, through the power of Twitter and RSS, I am hoping that other GiveCamp UK attendees can make suggestions to add to the list, that way I will have everything installed that is required.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>UPDATE 1: Added additional clients for VCS&rsquo;s, as well as kDiff, WinMerge (see <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=188">here</a> for Visual Studio setup) and Putty</p></li>
<li><p>UPDATE 2: Twitter Client added to the list</p></li>
<li><p>UPDATE 3: Added more VCS Clients to the list</p></li>
<li><p>UPDATE 4: Added some notes following feedback from attending GiveCamp UK, as well as pieces of hardware you might want to bring with you</p></li>

<p><strong>Hardware</strong></p>

<p>In addition to the software listed above, you might also want to think about taking the following pieces of hardware:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Network Hub/Switch - for use by your team members</p></li>
<li><p>Multi Gang Power Extension Lead - in case there are limited plugs available</p></li>
<li><p>Headphones</p></li>
<li><p>Your own keyboard - if like me you use an ergonomic keyboard</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Am I missing anything important that will be required for use at GiveCamp? I will update this blog post as I think about new things, and as suggestions are made.</p>

<p>Thanks to an email from Amazon, I have just found out that the new Stuart MacBride book is ready for pre-order, so I have just ordered it <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/wlEmoticon-smile2.png" alt="Smile" />.</p>

<p>The new book is called “<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0007344171/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0007344171">Birthdays for the Dead</a>”.</p>

<p>If you have never read any Stuart MacBride books, I would roughly recommend that you do.  I picked up his first book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0007193149/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0007193149">Cold Granite</a>, when I was going through Aberdeen Airport on a business trip, and since then, I have bought and read all his books.</p>

<p>The main series of books are based around Detective Logan McRae, who works for the Grampian Police in Aberdeen.  I have always liked the fact that I can read the book and know exactly where the characters are, and the local dialect used in the conversations is always good for a laugh!  There is definitely a serious tone to the books though, with crimes ranging from murder, to kidnap, to mob related executions, and drugs, so they are not for the faint hearted!</p>

<p>Like two of his other books, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0007349262/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0007349262">Halfhead</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1842999575/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=1842999575">Sawbones</a>, this new one takes a break from the Logan MacRae series, so I am really looking forward to reading it and seeing what it is like.  I will post a review once I have read it.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Like most geeks, I have both a desktop PC and a laptop (if I am being honest, I also have a NetBook as well). From time to time, I will be using these at the same time. Whether it is to do the monthly virus scans and updates, or whether it is transferring files between the two, etc.</p>

<p>Before finding “<a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/next/archive/2011/09/09/microsoft-garage-download-mouse-without-borders.aspx">Mouse without Borders</a>” it was a case of switching between the keyboard and mouse of my desktop, over to the keyboard and track pad of the laptop, but no more! Now I just use the same keyboard and mouse, and I get a flawless transition between each desktop.</p>

<p>Once setup, you can position tell “<a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/next/archive/2011/09/09/microsoft-garage-download-mouse-without-borders.aspx">Mouse without Borders</a>” how you want your machines configured, I have mine setup as follows:</p>

<p>and there are a host of options that you can configure:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/image1.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/image_thumb1.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>There are other products on the market that do a similar job, for instance <a href="http://www.inputdirector.com/">InputDirector</a>, but I have never tried this software.</p>
