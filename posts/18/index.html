		<p>As some of you may know, I have been a big fan of <a href="http://learnvisualstudio.net/">LearnVisualStudio.net</a> for some time now, and I have a Lifetime Subscription with them. Basically, this means that every time a new video gets created, I can download them free of charge.</p>

<p>They have recently released some new series of videos on such topics as Windows Phone 7 and Silverlight 4, so they are certainly not behind in their technology.</p>

<p>I just received an email informing me that it is their 9th Anniversary, and because of this, they are now offering a 30% discount on there subscriptions, so if you don’t already have one, I would highly recommend that you take advantage of the offer.</p>

<p>With the discount, a 1 Year Membership is coming in at $48.97, and a lifetime subscription for $139.97.</p>

<p>Bargain!!</p>

<p>You can take advantage of the offer here:</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Unfortunately, it is not at work, and it also doesn’t involved a pay rise, but…</p>

<p>I have been promoted from a “Moderator” to a “Super Moderator” over at <a href="http://www.vbforums.com/index.php">VBForums</a>. I have been a member of this forum since 2004, and primarily I post in the ASP.Net Forum, trying to help people where I can, but with the creation of a Silverlight, ASP.Net and WPF/WCF/WF Forums, I think I will be posting in these forums on a more regular basis.</p>

<p>I was given the title of Moderator back in December, and I guess I have been doing a good job, as I have been given the role of Super Moderator (admittedly, I had asked to become a Moderator in the above mentioned Forums, but I wasn’t expecting to be given the elevated title).</p>

<p>Still trying to work out exactly what additional capabilities this gives me on the site, but I am sure that I will figure it out as I go <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" />.</p>

		<p>Hot on the heels of DDD9 in Reading, there are other DDD related events coming up in the near future.</p>

<p>DDD Belfast – March 2011</p>

<p><a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/scotland2011/">DDD Scotland – May 7th 2011</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.dddsouthwest.com/">DDD South West – June 11th 2011</a></p>

<p><em>(The home page for the DDD Events is <a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/home/">here</a>)</em></p>

<p>Unfortunately, I haven’t heard too much about DDD Belfast, and there doesn’t seem to be any information on the DDD site. I am not going to be able to make this event anyway, but it would still be nice to see what I will be missing out on.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.dddsouthwest.com/images/DDDScotland.png" alt="" />DDD Scotland is at the stage that speakers have submitted there proposed sessions, and the community is now voting on them. For your chance to have a say about what sessions get included, make sure you vote for your favourites. I am really hoping to attend this event, as there are a number of proposed sessions, which if picked, I will be very interested in attending!!</p>

<p><img src="http://www.dddsouthwest.com/images/DDDSouthWest3BadgeSmall.png" alt="" />DDD South West is at the stage of looking for speakers. I would love to think that I am at the stage that I could think about submitting a session, but I know I am not. This is an area that I am hoping to move into, and with the help of Guy Smith-Ferrier’s video series <a href="http://www.guysmithferrier.com/post/2011/02/Video-Series-How-To-Give-Great-Presentations.aspx">here</a>, maybe I will think about submitting a session next year. Again, looking at some of the proposed sessions, I can see a lot of benefit in attending this event. It is obviously slightly further away, but would still be worth it.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/onenote-2010-create-a-note-from-anywhere/" itemprop="url">OneNote 2010 – Create a Note From Anywhere</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>_This is the second in a <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=53">series of blog posts</a> I’m doing on the features that I now find invaluable within Microsoft OneNote 2010. _</p>

<p><strong>The Situation:</strong></p>

<p>Sitting at your computer, you are happily coding away on your project and you get a visit from your project manager, and he is pissed!!! You are not expecting him, and you are not ready for the barrage of questions that he is throwing at you. You need time to think, so you ask to have a meeting with him later that day, to which he says <em>“That’s fine, but make sure you have all the information that I asked for!!!”</em></p>

<p><strong>The Problem:</strong></p>

<p>Due to the fact that you were completely unprepared for this impromptu meeting, you didn’t write down any notes from the discussion that you just had, and you are now struggling to remember everything that was asked of you. Since your manager was pissed, you can’t really go and ask him to recap the questions that he asked of you (well, <em>yes</em>, you could, and that is actually what you would do, but let me try to illustrate my point). You should have started writing things down as he started asking them but you can never find any paper when you need it, and your pen never works!! Argh!!</p>

<p><strong>The OneNote Solution:</strong></p>

<p>Once OneNote is up installed on your machine, it is always available, for any application. Simply by pressing the “Windows Key + N” you will be presented with an area into which you can start writing notes, shown here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image3.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb3.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>This isn’t the full OneNote application, but rather a stripped down version of it, with some rudimentary formatting options, and a space to start entering text. As a result, it opens almost immediately, and you can literally start typing directly into it.</p>

<p>To follow on from the situation above, as your manager is harassing you with questions, you can quickly jot down some notes from the discussion, and then expand on them later, once he has gone.</p>

<p>Everything you type into this note is saved straight away, with no need for you to do anything else, just type the text, and then close the note. To get the note back later, fire open OneNote, and you will see a section called “Unfiled Notes” at the bottom left hand side:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image4.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb4.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>This is where all your “quick” notes end up. The idea being that you either delete them once you are finished with them, or you add them into one of your other Notebooks or sections.</p>

<p>So, the next time you see your Manager storming your way, all you need to do are two things…</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Hit “Windows Key + M” – you don’t want him to see you sitting with Twitter or FaceBook open</p></li>
<li><p> Hit “Windows Key + N” – ready to start writing notes for the discussion you are about to have.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Hope this helps!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p><em>This is the first in a </em><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=53"><em>series of blog posts</em></a><em> I’m doing on the features that I now find invaluable within Microsoft OneNote 2010.</em></p>

<p><strong>The Situation:</strong></p>

<p>At work we use SharePoint to store pretty much all of our Project Documents. This includes the use of Blogs, Wikis, Document Libraries, Lists, Sites, Site Collections, and Technical Discussion Boards to capture all of the day to day information about a Project.</p>

<p>When it comes to finding an error, or tracking down a problem within a particular piece of software, I want to capture the run up to the problem, the steps to reproduce it, screenshots, attempts to fix, the resolution, etc., so that if it happens again, I would be able to remember what I did before.</p>

<p>9 times out of 10, this would end up as an internal blog post which I could search at a later date to look up the problem.</p>

<p><strong>The Problem:</strong></p>

<p>As with most software problems, you typically get some sort of error message…</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p><em>Here is one I created earlier….</em></p>

<p>In order to be useful, and searchable, I would normally type out the entire contents of the error message into the blog post, so that when it happens again, I can take the text from the error message and search for it directly within my blog. Sounds simple right? Now, imagine that you have a very long error message, or perhaps a stack trace included within the prompt. Typing all this out by hand can be quite tedious.</p>

<p><strong>The OneNote Solution:</strong></p>

<p>By default, when you insert an image into a OneNote Note, the text within that picture (if there is any) is automatically made searchable. You can verify this by right clicking on the image and looking at “Make Text in Image Searchable”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image1.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb1.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>From within this menu you have the option of turning this feature off, as well as selecting the language that you want to use for the text recognition.</p>

<p>When it comes to searching for the text of interest, just hit “CTRL+F”, type the text you want, and then click through the results:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image2.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb2.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>In the above, notice how the text that was searched for in the top right hand corner immediately became highlighted within the image that had been pasted into the Note.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Following an introduction to Microsoft OneNote 2007 by a colleague at work, I find myself using OneNote more and more things within my work day. Taking minutes of meetings, writing ToDo lists, capturing information about products that I am using, bugs that I am finding, etc. There are so many things that OneNote “just does”, that I now find invaluable.</p>

<p>Now, thanks to the Microsoft Home Use Program I am the proud owner of Microsoft Office Professional 2010, including OneNote 2010, and I now find myself using OneNote both at home, and on my Windows Phone 7.</p>

<p>This post is going to be the parent post for a series of posts where I am going to describe the features that I have come to rely on within OneNote 2010 (some of these features are not going to be specific to OneNote 2010, they may have existed within earlier versions, but any screenshots and descriptions that are provided will be based on OneNote 2010).</p>

<p>I will update this page with links to the individual posts I do as I publish them:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=60">Number 1 – Make Text in Image Searchable</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=69">Number 2 – Create a note from anywhere</a></p>

<p>Hope you find these features as useful as I have!</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/streaming-movies-from-synology-server-to-ps3/" itemprop="url">Streaming Movies From Synology Server to PS3</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p><em>NOTE: I am not advocating the illegal ripping of DVDs.  Every DVD that I rip onto my server I own, and I am simply using this approach to make the watching of DVDs easier across the various TVs and computers that I have in my house.</em></p>

<p>Since getting my <a href="http://www.synology.com/us/products/ds410/index.php">Synology Server</a> (which I LOVE, by the way), I have been wondering about how I can “rip” DVDs onto this server, which I could then watch downstairs on my PS3.  I did some searching, and everything I found seemed overly complicated, and the ones that I tried ended up not working correctly.</p>

<p>However, after talking to a few colleagues, and some additional searching, I found the following two packages:</p>

<p><strong>MakeMKV:</strong> <a href="http://www.makemkv.com/">http://www.makemkv.com/</a></p>

<p><strong>PS3Muxer:</strong> <a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=148627">http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=148627</a></p>

<p>The first package does the job of “ripping” the actual audio and video content from the DVD/Blu-Ray onto your computer, and placing it into a MKV container.  I was sort of hoping that this one action was going to be enough to stream the content to the PS3, however, the MKV format is not supported on the PS3.</p>

<p>As a result, a second step is required, and this is where PS3Muxer steps in.  It takes the MKV container (.mkv), and translates it into a .m2ts file, which is possible to stream to the PS3.</p>

<p>Personally, I would prefer that this was a one step action, rather than two, but for now, I am happy to do this “extra” step.</p>

<p>If anyone has got any thoughts on a better approach to the above, then I would be very interested to hear about it.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I recently found out (thanks @stack72) that it was possible to register for a bit.ly pro account, which would allow you to set up a custom short domain for shortening url&rsquo;s in things like twitter and blogs posts.</p>

<p>You might have seen this in the links that the likes that Scott Hanselman uses, for instance <a href="http://hnsl.mn/...">http://hnsl.mn/&#8230;</a>  He specifically registered the domain hnsl.mn (which is his last name without the vowels).  Whenever he adds a link to a tweet, the full url gets shortened and uses his base custom domain to identify that it came from him.</p>

<p>When I first saw this, I thought that you would have to pay for the privilege, but that is not the case (aside from the initial cost of the purchase of the domain that is).</p>

<p>The steps are fairly simple, and break down like this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Purchase your custom short domain.  Personally, I went for gep13.me</p></li>
<li><p> <a href="http://bit.ly/a/pro_request">Register for a bit.ly pro account</a></p></li>
<li><p> Once the registration completes, and is authorised, you will have access to configure your custom domain</p></li>
<li><p> You will be prompted to change the A record for your domain to point at the bit.ly servers</p></li>
<li><p> Once you have done that, you will have to verify these settings (you will like need to wait a while, like I did, for the DNS change to filter through the DNS servers across the world, before bit.ly can see it)</p></li>
<li><p> With that in place, you can configure the Dashboard Tracking Domain that you want to use, for me, I just used my own domain</p></li>
<li><p> Then, you are all set, all you need to do after that is configure your favourite package to use it.  Again, for me, this is Seesmic, and all I had to do here is take the bit.ly API Key from within bit.ly and paste it into Seesmic</p></li>
</ol>


<p>From now on, any link that I shorten through Seesmic will always start with gep13.me.</p>

<p>Simples!</p>
