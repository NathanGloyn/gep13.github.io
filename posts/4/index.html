		<h1>What is TeamCity?</h1>

<p>Just in case you didn&rsquo;t know&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>TeamCity is a user-friendly continuous integration (CI) server for professional developers and build engineers, like ourselves. It is trivial to setup and absolutely free for small teams.</blockquote>


<p>If you want to find out more information about TeamCity, you can find it <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/index.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>The following blog post walks through the steps to get TeamCity installed., however, at the end of this blog post there will still be other items that need to be configured, but these issues will be the topics of other blog posts.</p>

<p>Although out of the box TeamCity uses an internal database based on the HSQLDB database engine, if you are planning on using a TeamCity instance for Production purposes, it is <a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/TCD7/Setting+up+an+External+Database">strongly recommended</a> that you set up an external database connection for it to use.  To that end, this blog post uses a MySQL Database as the external connection for TeamCity.</p>

<h1>Installation Steps</h1>

<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>The following installation steps and screenshots were taken from a virtual machine   with Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1, running in Hyper-V on a Windows 8 Host Machine.</p>

<p>These instructions are specific to version 7.1.3 of TeamCity, however, later versions will likely follow very similar steps.  In addition, these installation instructions will install both the TeamCity Server and Build Agent onto the same machine.  Ideally, you would want to have a separate Build Agent Machine.</p>

<p>You can see screenshots of each of these steps in the galley at the bottom of this blog post.</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Assumption is that you already have <a href="http://gep13.me/S91bws">MySQL Community Server</a> installed</p></li>
<li><p> Assumption is that you already have <a href="http://gep13.me/WiiHcN">MySQL Workbench</a> installed</p></li>
<li><p> Assumption is that you already have configured a <a href="http://gep13.me/Z3jaBI">Profile Instance, with a database and user</a> that can be used by the TeamCity Server</p></li>
<li><p> Download the <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/download/index.html">latest version of TeamCity from the JetBrains website</a> then double-click the .exe and click Run</p></li>
<li><p> At the first step in the installation wizard simply click Next</p></li>
<li><p> Read the License Agreement and assuming you are happy with it, click &ldquo;I Agree&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p> In the &ldquo;Choose Install Location&rdquo; window, assuming you are happy with the default installation folder, simply click Next, otherwise change it first</p></li>
<li><p> In the &ldquo;Choose Components&rdquo; window choose the components that you want to install.  As already mentioned, we will be installing both the Server and Build Agent on one server.  Click Next</p></li>
<li><p> In the &ldquo;Specify server configuration directory&rdquo; window assuming you are happy with the default location click Next, other change it first</p></li>
<li><p>. The main portion of the installation will start now</p></li>
<li><p>. In the &ldquo;Installation Complete&rdquo; windows, specify the port that you want TeamCity to run under.  I have other services running on this server, so I have chosen to use port 8080.  Choose something that won&rsquo;t conflict, and then click Next</p></li>
<li><p>. The &ldquo;Configure Build Agent Properties&rdquo; window will then open, giving you the opportunity to add/edit build agent properties.  For now, you can leave this as the default.  If needed, this can be changed later.  Click Save.</p></li>
<li><p>. Simply click OK on the &ldquo;TeamCity Build Agent Properties&rdquo; pop-up</p></li>
<li><p>. In the &ldquo;Select Service Account for Server&rdquo; window decide what user account you want to run the TeamCity Server, I chose to use the SYSTEM account.  Click Next</p></li>
<li><p>. In the &ldquo;Select Service Account for Agent&rdquo; window decide what user account you want to run the TeamCity Build Agent, I chose to use the SYSTEM account.  Click Next</p></li>
<li><p>. In the &ldquo;Services&rdquo; window, choose to start both the Server and Build Agent Services, and click Next</p></li>
<li><p>. In the final screen, ensure that the option to open TeamCity Website after exit is checked and click Finish.</p></li>
<li><p>. You will then be taken to the default start screen, which as mentioned will create the internal database that TeamCity would normally use by default.  Go ahead and click Proceed, we will then begin editing the configuration to use a MySQL Server Database.</p></li>
<li><p>. A web page will open saying &ldquo;TeamCity is starting&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>. Once this page reloads, and show the license agreement page, open windows explorer and navigate to the configuration directory, the default is C:\ProgramData\JetBrains\TeamCity</p></li>
<li><p>. Open the services snap-in and stop both the TeamCity Build Agent and TeamCity Server services</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Hit the Start button</p></li>
<li><p>Type &ldquo;services.msc&rdquo; and press Enter</p></li>
<li><p>Find each named service and click stop</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>. Back to Windows Explorer, navigate into the configuration folder.  Find the database.mysql.properties.dist file.  Copy and paste this file, and rename the newly created file as database.properties (NOTE: This name is very important.  Compare to the screenshot below to ensure it is correct.</p></li>
<li><p>. Open the database.properties file and notice the section that you have to update</p></li>
<li><p>. Make the necessary changes and save the file (NOTE: I have added an extra configuration line to use UTF-8 character encoding, which if you followed the <a href="http://gep13.me/Z3jaBI">Profile Instance, with a database and user</a> is what your database will use</p></li>
<li><p>. Open an internet browser and download the latest JDBC driver for MySQL.  The main download site can be found <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>. Browse to where you downloaded the driver and extract the contents of the download.  Find the .jar file and copy this into the lib folder within the TeamCity configuration directory.  Typically C:\ProgramData\JetBrains\TeamCity\lib\jdbc</p></li>
<li><p>. Open the services snap-in and start both the TeamCity Server, and TeamCity Build Agent services</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Hit the Start button</p></li>
<li><p>Type &ldquo;services.msc&rdquo; and press Enter</p></li>
<li><p>Find each named service and click start</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>. Open an internet browser and open the TeamCity home page.  As per these installation instructions, that would be <a href="http://localhost:8080,">http://localhost:8080,</a> but the port may be different depending on what you selected.  You will get a warning about the Database being empty.  That is to be expected, as we have only just set this up, and it doesn&rsquo;t contain anything</p></li>
<li><p>. Click the link entitled &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a server administrator, show me the details&rdquo;.  We need to locate the authentication token, before TeamCity will let us continue with the setup.  To do this, we have to open the log file for the TeamCity instance</p></li>
<li><p>. Open windows explorer, and navigate to the TeamCity installation folder, typically this is C:\TeamCity and find the logs folder, and in that folder, the teamcity-server.log.  Open this file.</p></li>
<li><p>. Scroll to the end of this log file, and the last line in the log file should contain the authentication token.  Copy this token to your clipboard</p></li>
<li><p>. Go back to the internet browser, and paste the token and click Confirm.  This will take you to the &ldquo;TeamCity Database Creation&rdquo; window.  Confirm that the details are correct, and click Proceed</p></li>
<li><p>. TeamCity will then create the database and finish configuration setup</p></li>
<li><p>. If you are interested, you can open MySQL Workbench and look at all the tables that have just been created</p></li>
<li><p>. Back in the internet browser, you should be presented with the TeamCity license agreement again.  Read through this, and when happy click the &ldquo;Accept license agreement&rdquo; check box, and then click Continue</p></li>
<li><p>. Enter the details for an administrator account that you will use to administer this TeamCity instance and click Create Account</p></li>
<li><p>. Job done!</p></li>
</ol>


<p>You can see screenshots of each of these steps in the galley at the bottom of this blog post.</p>

<p>There are still steps remaining in terms of setting up projects, build configurations, and other TeamCity settings, but these will be topics for other blog posts.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<h1>Creating a MySQL Server Instance Profile with a Database and User</h1>

<p>Assuming that you have a MySQL Server installation on your machine, it is normally necessary to configure both a Server Instance Profile, and at least one database to be used within that Instance Profile.  The following steps walk through the necessary steps to do this, using an example of creating a Database that could be used for a TeamCity installation.  Some of the steps are specific to this end goal, however, the steps should be generic enough that they can be tailored to your needs.</p>

<h1>Configuration Steps</h1>

<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>The following installation steps and screenshots were taken from a virtual machine   with Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1, running in Hyper-V on a Windows 8 Host Machine.</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Assumption is that you already have <a href="http://gep13.me/S91bws">MySQL Community Server</a> installed</p></li>
<li><p> Assumption is that you already have <a href="http://gep13.me/WiiHcN">MySQL Workbench</a> installed</p></li>
<li><p> Open MySQL Workbench</p></li>
<li><p> Click on the &ldquo;New Server Instance&rdquo; link</p></li>
<li><p> In the &ldquo;Specify Host Machine&rdquo; Window leave as default and click Next</p></li>
<li><p> In the &ldquo;Database Connection&rdquo; Window leave as default and click Next</p></li>
<li><p> On the &ldquo;Test DB Connection&rdquo; Window ensure that all tested passed and click Next</p></li>
<li><p> Before the next step, we need a Configuration File that MySQL Server can use to instantiate the Server Instance.  The default MySQL Server installation comes with pre-configured configuration files, located at C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.5 (where 5.5. is the version number of MySQL Server you have installed)</p></li>
<li><p> Copy the sample Configuration File that you want to have (I chose my-small) to another location on your hard drive.  For simplicity I chose the root of the C:\ drive, and I renamed the file to my.ini.</p></li>
<li><p>. In the &ldquo;Windows Management&rdquo; window browse to the location that you copied the configuration file and select it. Press Next.</p></li>
<li><p>. In the &ldquo;Test Settings&rdquo; window ensure that all test passed and click Next</p></li>
<li><p>. Click &ldquo;Continue&rdquo; when the &ldquo;Review Settings&rdquo; pop-up appears</p></li>
<li><p>. In the &ldquo;Complete Setup&rdquo; window click Finish</p></li>
<li><p>. Once back at the home page of MySQL Workbench, double-click on the instance that you have just created</p></li>
<li><p>. In the Admin tab, select &ldquo;Users and Privileges&rdquo; and click &ldquo;Add Account&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>. Enter the details for the user that you want to create, in this case I have chosen &ldquo;teamcity&rdquo; as the username and entered a password for this user.  Once completed, click Apply.</p></li>
<li><p>. Go back to the home page of MySQL Workbench by clicking the Home tab</p></li>
<li><p>. Double click onto the localhost connection</p></li>
<li><p>. Click the Create Schema button, and provide a name for the schema, I have chosen teamcity, and then click Apply</p></li>
<li><p>. On the &ldquo;Review SQL Script&rdquo; window click Apply</p></li>
<li><p>. On the &ldquo;Apply SQL Script&rdquo; window click Finish</p></li>
<li><p>. The <a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/TCD7/Configuring+UTF8+Character+Set+for+MySQL">recommended Collation and Charset for using TeamCity</a> (the application that is going to be using this database is utf8 - utf8_bin, if you require this, select this in the drop down list and click Apply</p></li>
<li><p>. On the &ldquo;Review SQL Script&rdquo; window click Apply</p></li>
<li><p>. On the &ldquo;Apply SQL Script&rdquo; window click Finish</p></li>
<li><p>. Return to the Admin screen by clicking on that tab</p></li>
<li><p>. Select &ldquo;Users and Privileges&rdquo; and click on the &ldquo;Schema Privileges&rdquo; tab and select the User that you want to create a permission for, and then click Add Entry</p></li>
<li><p>. In the &ldquo;New Schema Privilege Definition&rdquo; window select which hosts you want this user to be able to access the schema from (I have chosen to limit this to localhost, which is the most secure.  Also, map the user to the schema that you want them to access.  Again in this case, I have chosen the teamcity schema, so there is a mapping between the teamcity user and schema.  Once completed, click OK</p></li>
<li><p>. Once back at the main window, click &ldquo;Select &#8220;ALL&rdquo; to give this user all database permissions (you may want to only select certain options, depending on what you require).  Once you are happy, click &ldquo;Save Changes&rdquo;</p></li>
</ol>

		<h1>Time to get chocolatey&hellip;</h1>

<p>If you are not already familiar with <a href="http://chocolatey.org/">chocolatey nuget</a>, let me give you a brief introduction.</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;Chocolatey NuGet is a Machine Package Manager, somewhat like apt-get, but built with Windows in mind.&#8221;</blockquote>


<p>What does this mean?  It means that once you have chocolatey nuget installed, you can easily install applications (packages), that are stored in the chocolatey gallery, with a single command.  What&rsquo;s more, if these packages are ever updated, you can update them on your machine using, again, a single command.</p>

<p>If you want to find out more information about chocolatey nuget you can browse the available packages <a href="http://chocolatey.org/packages">here</a>, read the documentation <a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki">here</a>, and ask questions on the forum <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/chocolatey">here</a>.</p>

<h1>Installation Steps</h1>

<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>The following installation steps and screenshots were taken from a virtual machine   with Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1, running in Hyper-V on a Windows 8 Host Machine.</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Open a Command Prompt as Administrator</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Hit the Start button</p></li>
<li><p>Type &ldquo;cmd&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>Right click on the &ldquo;cmd&rdquo; icon</p></li>
<li><p>Click &ldquo;Run as administrator&rdquo;</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p> Enter the following command (you can simply copy/paste this command) and then press the &ldquo;Enter&rdquo; key:</p></li>
</ol>


<blockquote>@powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy unrestricted -Command &#8220;iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString(&#8216;http://chocolatey.org/install.ps1&#8217;))&#8221; && SET PATH=%PATH%;%systemdrive%\chocolatey\bin</blockquote>


<ol>
<li><p> The installation of chocolatey will begin</p></li>
<li><p> The installation will complete</p></li>
</ol>


<p>You can see screenshots of each of these steps in the gallery at the bottom of this blog post.</p>

<h1>What has the installation done</h1>

<p>Once the installation is complete you will notice a few immediate changes on your computer.</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Chocolatey will have added a number of folders/files to the root of your c:\ drive.</p></li>
<li><p> Chocolatey will have added some environment variables to allow the commands that is provides work</p></li>
</ol>


<h1>Post Installation Checks</h1>

<p>To verify that verify is working correctly:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Open PowerShell as an Administrator (not strictly required, but a good habit to get into)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Hit the Start button</p></li>
<li><p>Type &ldquo;PowerShell&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>Right click on the &ldquo;Windows PowerShell&rdquo; icon</p></li>
<li><p>Click &ldquo;Run as administrator&rdquo;</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p> Type &ldquo;chocolatey help&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p> If everything is working correctly, you should get some output confirming the version of chocolatey nuget installed, as well as some information about it.</p></li>
</ol>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/2012-my-year-in-review/" itemprop="url">2012 - My Year in Review</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<h1>2012, what happened?</h1>

<p>In the same way that I did a <a href="http://gep13.me/U9X0O1">review of my year in 2011</a>, I have decided to do the same thing again for 2012.</p>

<h1>What I said I was going to do</h1>

<p>The below is what I &ldquo;said&rdquo; I was going to do in 2012.  I will refer back to this in this post to see whether I actually achieved any of this or not.</p>

<blockquote>Looking forward into 2012, there will mainly be more of the same as above.  Following [the principles](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=313) that I took from Mark Rendle’s talk at DDD South West I will be looking to improve myself as a developer, but I also hope to break into doing talks at some of these community events, rather than simply attending them.  This will be a big step for me, but something that I am very much looking forward to.

I will be continuing to blog next year as well, however, I am looking to writing much more technical blog posts.  I have learnt a lot this year from all the talks that I have attended, and I am looking to implement these technologies in a number of pet projects.  I will be blogging the trials and tribulations that I have along the way, which will hopefully help other people.</blockquote>


<h1>Getting involved in the Development Community</h1>

<p>2012 saw the <a href="http://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/">Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group</a> continue growing.  We partnered with Scottish Developers in order to bring a number of big names to Scotland, including <a href="http://gep13.me/Rnkws5">Sebastien Lambla</a>, <a href="http://gep13.me/U9U441">Matt Lacey</a>, and of course who can forget <a href="http://gep13.me/U9VWJU">Scott Hanselman</a>.  This year also saw me become a <a href="http://gep13.me/ZPhQbK">Committee Member of Scottish Developers</a>, and these partnership events at set to continue into 2013.</p>

<p>I attended a number of Developer Events this year, including <a href="http://gep13.me/xYEALH">Windows Azure Bootcamp</a>, <a href="http://gep13.me/U9WP5n">Windows Phone 7 Bootcamp</a>, <a href="http://gep13.me/VhBYfB">DevWeek</a>, <a href="http://gep13.me/Vpe5Ch">DDD South West</a>, and <a href="http://gep13.me/WbMxQx">DDD North</a>.  I very much enjoyed each of these events, and with the exception of DevWeek, each of these events were completely free!  If you are interested in getting involved in some of these events, I would strongly recommend it, they are well worth attending!</p>

<p>Following on from my attendance at <a href="http://gep13.me/Rno3a0">GiveCamp UK</a>, Daniel Elliot (<a href="https://twitter.com/agileguy">@agileguy</a>) continued to support <a href="http://theyoucanhub.org.uk/">TheYouCanHub</a>.  This saw us move their hosting onto a Virtual Private Server, provided by Dan, and also numerous changes to their site.  This support is going to continue into 2013 as time allows.</p>

<h1>From a personal stand point</h1>

<p>I was able to fully break into the speaking circuit, doing talks at both <a href="http://gep13.me/WfOcEW">DDD South West</a> and <a href="http://gep13.me/U9WU94">DDD North</a>.  I was really happy with the feedback that I got from both of these talks, and this has encouraged me to continue doing more talks in 2013.</p>

<p>I went on a <a href="http://gep13.me/RoM9RF">Photography Course</a> that I was given as a birthday present.  I had a really good day out, and although I learned a lot, I realised that I still have a lot to learn!</p>

<p>I enjoyed a really good round of golf at the newly created <a href="http://gep13.me/UFCZks">Trump International Scotland</a>, Donald Trump&rsquo;s new Golf Course.  We got a great day for playing golf, and I even managed to birdie one of the par 5&rsquo;s on the course!</p>

<p>I had to say goodbye to an <a href="http://gep13.me/RoB8Qj">old friend</a> in the form of my beloved Ford Focus, but happily this was replaced with a new Ford Focus.</p>

<p>I had an amazing day out at the <a href="http://gep13.me/Ua1d49">Phoenix Falconry Centre</a>, so much so that I have booked myself on another day out which will be happening in either January or February of this year.  Really looking forward to it!  I will post some photos once I have been on it.</p>

<p>With the help of Paul Stack (<a href="https://twitter.com/stack72">@stack72</a>), a Windows Phone 7 application called TeamCity Metro came into being.  We released <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/windows-phone-application/teamcity-metro/teamcitymetro-v1.0.0.0/">Version 1.0.0.0</a>, quickly followed by <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/windows-phone-application/teamcity-metro/teamcity-metro-v-1.1.0.0/">Version 1.1.0.0</a>.  There are plans to make this into a Windows Phone 8 application as well, but that will be time dependent.</p>

<p>I am happy to say that my wife was able to put up with me, and we celebrated our second Wedding Anniversary.</p>

<p>I started using <a href="http://gep13.me/WbOKeJ">Windows 8 and Office 2013</a>, and I really like them!  I also treated myself to a Windows Surface RT and also upgraded to the Nokia Lumia 920.</p>

<p>At the very end of 2012, I got involved in exposing a scam on the internet in the form of the <a href="http://gep13.me/Rnmt88">WP Discovery Twitter account</a>.  I am very happy to say that this scam account which was trying to collect people&rsquo;s personal information has now been shut down.</p>

<h1>So, did I do what I said I was going to?</h1>

<p>With the exception of the more technical focused blogging, I think that I have been able to meet the goals that I set out at the start of the year.</p>

<h1>Looking forward to 2013</h1>

<p>Looking forward into 2013, I am aiming to continue doing what I have been doing this year. I hope to continue doing developer talks, and I am looking forward to attending the various DDD events across the UK, and also helping to organise them in my new role with Scottish Developers.  I am looking forward to bringing more technical talks to the people in Aberdeen, with the help of Aberdeen Developers.</p>

<p>Last year, I aimed to start a number of pet projects which would help to develop my technical abilities, however, an important project at work took up a lot of my spare time, and I am hoping to continue/start those pet projects in 2013.</p>

<p>And that, as they say, is that!  I hope you all had a great 2012, and here&rsquo;s to 2013!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<h1>What were the stats?</h1>

<p>Last year around this time, I wrote a blog post about the stats for my blog in 2011, you can see this blog post <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/stats-for-my-blog-in-2011/">here</a>.</p>

<p>It is now time to see what the stats were for 2012 and compare these to the previous years stats.</p>

<p>First up, what does Google Analytics have to say about it:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/stats-for-my-blog-in-2012/google_analytics_results/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Google_Analytics_Results-1024x408.png" alt="Google_Analytics_Results" /></a></p>

<p>Highlights being:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>7,616 Visits (an increase of 3,134 on last year)</p></li>
<li><p>6,252 Unique Visitors (an increase of 3,23 on last year)</p></li>
<li><p>10,485 Pageviews (an increase of 3,284 on last year)</p></li>
<li><p>1.38 Pages/Visit (a decrease of 0.23 on last year)</p></li>
<li><p>00:01:42 Avg. Time on Site (a decrease of 00:00:07 on last year)</p></li>
<li><p>72.87% Bounce Rate (a decrease of 2.59% on last year)</p></li>
<li><p>80.53% % of New Visits (an increase of 13.66% on last year)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Overall, I am really happy with these results.  I spent a lot more time working on the blog this year, and I am pleased to see an increase in traffic to the blog.</p>

<p>Thanks again to the amazing <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jetpack/">Jetpack plugin for WordPress</a>, I am able to share some more stats:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/stats-for-my-blog-in-2012/crunchy_numbers_from_jetpack/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Crunchy_Numbers_from_Jetpack.png" alt="Crunchy_Numbers_from_Jetpack" /></a></p>

<p>My top 5 blog posts were:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/scott-hanselman-doing-user-group-tour-of-scotland/">Scott Hanselman doing user group tour of Scotland</a></p></li>

</ul>


<p>In 2012, there were actually 28 posts fewer than in 2011.  However, the busy day increased to 410 views, compared to 279 views in 2011.</p>

<p>The keen-eyed amongst you will notice that 93 (the total number of posts at the end of 2011) plus, the total number of posts of 2012 which was 53, does not equal the total number of posts at the end of 2012 which was 229.  The reason for this is that during 2012, I copied some blog posts from an older incarnation of the gep13 blog, and added them here.</p>

<p>If you are interested in seeing the full report from Jetpack, you can find it <a href="http://jetpack.me/annual-report/23095201/2012/">here</a>.</p>

<h1>Happy New Year</h1>

<p>Finally, just wanted to wish everyone a Happy New Year, and all the best for 2013!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<h1>WP Discovery - Is it all a scam?</h1>

<h1>tl;dr</h1>

<p>I am happy to wait and see - but I&rsquo;ve seen no evidence to suggest it&rsquo;s <strong>NOT</strong> fake.  It all seems like an attempt to gain a large number of followers, to try to earn money.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>The WP Discovery Twitter account has now been closed as a result of legal action between Blockfall and WP Discovery.  This was WP Discovery&rsquo;s last tweet on the subject before their account was closed.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/what-is-going-on-with-wp-discovery/wp_ss_20130101_0004/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/wp_ss_20130101_0004.jpg" alt="wp_ss_20130101_0004" /></a></p>

<p>So to me, it looks as though it was all a scam, and to the best of my knowledge, no Nokia Lumia&rsquo;s, or Surfaces, or anything else, was given away by WP Discovery.</p>

<h1>The full story&hellip;</h1>

<p>In case you haven&rsquo;t been following what is going on over on Twitter, there is a growing concern that the Twitter Account for WP Discovery (<a href="https://twitter.com/wp_discovery">@wp_discovery</a>) is a scam.  For the last few days, perhaps as long as a week, they have been tweeting that they have various pieces of technology to give away.  Including things like Windows Surface RT&rsquo;s, Nokia Lumia 920&rsquo;s, and HTC 8x&rsquo;s, as well as other devices.  All you have to do is follow them, and retweet their tweets, and you are in with a chance to win.</p>

<p>This type of competition on Twitter is not new, and I have been involved in several of them.  I even got a free Office 365 t-shirt from one of them.</p>

<p>However, I personally have been starting to think that these giveaways are a little bit too good to be true.  And it is not just me that thinks that this is a scam.  Tom Warren (<a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren">@tomwarren</a>), Senior Editor at the Verge, tweeted this today:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/285021015434735616">https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/285021015434735616</a></p>

<p>It was also noted by Phil Jones (<a href="https://twitter.com/philjones88">@philjones88</a>) that the photo of the Surface that are being given away here:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/wp_discovery/status/284824914849038336">https://twitter.com/wp_discovery/status/284824914849038336</a></p>

<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>This used to link to a full status update from WP Discovery where they were showing two Windows Surface RT&rsquo;s that they were going to be &ldquo;giving away&rdquo;.  This image in question looked like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/what-is-going-on-with-wp-discovery/surfaces_to_give_away/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Surfaces_to_give_away.png" alt="Surfaces_to_give_away" /></a></p>

<p>is exactly the same as the Surfaces that are being sold in this <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/NEW-SEALED-MICROSOFT-SURFACE-32GB-WINDOWS-8-RT-BLACK-TOUCH-COVER-BUNDLE-/121007189503">eBay auction</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/what-is-going-on-with-wp-discovery/ebay_auction_for_surfaces/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Ebay_auction_for_Surfaces.png" alt="Ebay_auction_for_Surfaces" /></a></p>

<p>Now, you could argue that both decided to use the same picture, but surely, if you had a Surface to give away, right in front of you, you would take a picture of the actual devices, right?  WP Discovery later suggested that this is where they had purchased the Surfaces that they were going to be giving away, that is why the pictures were the same.</p>

<p>My suspicions were made even greater when I actually received a DM from WP Discovery.  In the space of 5-10 minutes, I received 3 DM&rsquo;s from them.  They went as follows:</p>

<p>DM Number 1:</p>

<blockquote>Hi. Ready four your DM? :)</blockquote>


<p>DM Number 2:</p>

<blockquote>Please reply in 2min. Since our script runs by itself to choose another winner instead. It&#8217;s your Surface man!</blockquote>


<p>DM Number 3:</p>

<blockquote>Sorry. You did not respond. We are picking a new one now</blockquote>


<p>(NOTE: You will see a screenshot of these DM&rsquo;s below in the gallery)</p>

<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I don&rsquo;t spend every waking minute on Twitter, and notifications from the Windows Phone application that I use takes a while to come through,  so needless to say, I wasn&rsquo;t able to reply within 2 minutes.  I am not sure that anyone would be able to.  Now, you could argue that this was just my bad luck, and good luck to the next guy, but if this were a legitimate competition then surely the DM that I sent back in response would have been answered.  However, it has now been over 6 hours since I DM&#8217;ed them, and I have not had any response from them.</p>

<p>What are your thoughts?  Let me know in the comments below.</p>

<p>I am still tempted to give these guys the benefit of the doubt, but when you see unanswered tweets like this from Scott Hanselman (<a href="https://twitter.com/shanselman">@shanselman</a>)</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/shanselman/status/285080261434175489">https://twitter.com/shanselman/status/285080261434175489</a></p>

<p>you have to wonder what is going on.  If there were just some more visibility about what is going on, and what the &ldquo;rules&rdquo; of the giveaway are, then I think that a lot more people would be willing to believe that this is on the &ldquo;up and up&rdquo;.</p>

<h1>Where to get help</h1>

<p>If you are in a position where you have handed over personal information, and you are worried what will happen to it, there are some places that you can go.  Here are a list of the ones that I know about, and I will update this list as I become aware of others:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://econsumer.gov/">International Consumer Protection and Enforcement Network</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx">Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3)</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>And of course, you can also block and mark the WP Discovery account.  This will raise the problem with Twitter themselves, and push them to investigate the problem.</p>

<p>Also, take a look at this <a href="http://www.craigmurphy.com/blog/?p=5586">blog post</a> from Craig Murphy, it has some tips on what to look for if something sounds to good to be true!</p>

<p>Also, remember to check out the comments below for some interesting addendum&#8217;s from the guys at WP Discovery.</p>

<h1>Update 2</h1>

<p>Since writing this blog post, I have been contacted by both WP Discovery, and by <a href="http://areon-development.de/">Areon Development</a>, the company behind the BlockFall game ( a game that WP Discovery seemed to be promoting).  They would like to make it clear that they are in no way connected to WP Discovery, and any promoting of Blockfall done by WP Discovery was done without the knowledge of Areon.  Areon Development have just posted a new blog onto their site, which you can find <a href="http://areon-development.de/?p=183">here</a>.  It reiterates that they are completely independent.</p>

<h1>Update 3</h1>

<p>Seems like last night was a busy night for WP Discovery.  They decided to ask all of their followers to ask them any questions that they might have about the competition.  This led to a number of questions about how it all works, what&rsquo;s involved, etc.  WP Discovery seemed to try to answer all of these questions (including some from me) and their answers didn&rsquo;t do anything to alleviate my concerns.  Some of their responses, and actions, were nothing if not outright rude.  I have begun capturing some screenshots of these conversations, as WP Discovery have a habit of deleting tweets.  If you have any screenshots that you would like to add to this gallery, then feel free to get in touch.</p>

<p>As requested in the comments below, you will see a screenshot of the DM&rsquo;s that I received from WP Discovery.  This was actually quite hard to find.  They no longer exist on the Twitter Website when I log in.  I can only assume that this is a result of WP Discovery blocking me, or something like this.  Lucky, I had them on my phone, which has a local cache of all the items that I have downloaded.</p>

<h1>Update 4</h1>

<p>Looks like a new Twitter account has been created called WP Discovery is Fake, you can find it <a href="https://twitter.com/WPDiscoveryFAKE">here</a>.  For the record, I had nothing to do with setting up this account.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/what-is-going-on-with-wp-discovery/2012-12-31_2017/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2012-12-31_2017.png" alt="2012-12-31_2017" /></a></p>

<h1>Update 5</h1>

<p>Thanks to Jesse Leskinen (<a href="https://twitter.com/jessenic">@jessenic</a>), I have just been given some screenshots to a DM exchange between him and WP Discovery.  This exchange shows Jesse actually winning the prize, but then WP Discovery backing out.  Check out these screenshots in the gallery below.  This is looking more and more like a scam.  Let me know what you think.</p>

<h1>Update 6</h1>

<p>Thanks to Miguel Avila (<a href="https://twitter.com/iMusice">@iMusice</a>) we have another DM conversation where WP Discovery have backed out of giving prizes.  Keep them coming! The more evidence that can be collected the better.</p>

<h1>Update 7</h1>

<p>Looks like there is now another &ldquo;parody&rdquo; account for WP Discovery been created.  This time in the form of George Patel (<a href="https://twitter.com/wp_discovery_pr">@wp_discovery_pr</a>).  The profile image and logo for the account are very similar to those of WP Discovery, but it does clearly say in the profile for the account that it is a parody account.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/what-is-going-on-with-wp-discovery/2012-12-31_1450/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2012-12-31_1450.png" alt="2012-12-31_1450" /></a></p>

<h1>Update 8</h1>

<p>I have just added another screenshot which confirms that WP Discovery were in fact following Jenna Kelly, which is something that they out right denied.  If nothing else, this proves that they are not honest.</p>

<h1>Update 9</h1>

<p>Yet another screenshot added, this time from Jeff Dunn (<a href="https://twitter.com/Jeff_Dunn">@Jeff_Dunn</a>).  More evidence of WP Discovery trying to gather positive ratings and feedback for applications in the Marketplace.</p>

<h1>Update 10</h1>

<p>Seems like another spoof account of WP Discovery has now popped up, this time in the form of WP Discovery (<a href="https://twitter.com/wp_discovery_">@wp_discovery_</a>), notice the extra underscore at the end of the name.  They have clearly identified themselves as a &ldquo;parody&rdquo; account, but just be careful, as looking at their feed, they seem to be taking the &ldquo;mick&rdquo; but some comments are dubious.  I would personally advise that you stay away from this account.  Again, for the record, I had nothing to do with setting up this account.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/what-is-going-on-with-wp-discovery/2012-12-31_2007/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2012-12-31_2007.png" alt="2012-12-31_2007" /></a></p>

<h1>Update 11</h1>

<p>I have added some links that I have seen in both the comments below, and on Twitter to where you can get help if you have inadvertently given out your personal information.  If anyone knows of additional sites to give to people, let me know and I will get them added to the main body of the blog post.</p>

<h1>Update 12</h1>

<p>Looks like more people are becoming aware of this issue.  Kimberly, over at <a href="http://stopmalvertising.com/">StopMalvertising</a> at written an excellent blog post of this topic.  You can find it <a href="http://stopmalvertising.com/spam-scams/warning-the-great-wp_discovery-giveaway.html">here</a>.  I have also added this to the list of bloggers in the main blog post.  I would strongly recommend that you add StopMalvertising to your RSS Feed Reader of choice, lots of interesting information there!</p>

<h1>Update 13</h1>

<p>WP Discovery decided that they should take it upon themselves to warm people about the &ldquo;other&rdquo; fake accounts associated with WP Discovery.  I laughed out loud (lol&#8217;ed for all you cool kids) when I first saw this!</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This screenshot was taken on Tuesday 1st January at the time shown in the screenshot, 17:02 GMT.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/what-is-going-on-with-wp-discovery/p__7e89/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/P__7E89.jpg" alt="P__7E89" /></a></p>

<h1>Update 14</h1>

<p>Changes seem to be afoot..  Craig Murphy (<a href="https://twitter.com/CAMURPHY">@CAMURPHY</a>) has noticed that WP Discovery are starting to delete all the tweets from their time line.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/CAMURPHY/status/286234160664813571">https://twitter.com/CAMURPHY/status/286234160664813571</a></p>

<p>As a result, I have had to update the text in the main blog post, as I had some links to tweets that no longer exist.</p>

<h1>Update 15</h1>

<p>After deleting all the tweets from their timeline, WP Discovery then left a single tweet on their timeline.  This Tweet changed after about 30 minutes though.  What is shown below are the two different tweets.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> These screenshots were taken on Tuesday 1st January at the time shown in the screenshot, 22:21 and  23:10 GMT respectively</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/what-is-going-on-with-wp-discovery/wp_ss_20130101_0002/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/wp_ss_20130101_0002.jpg" alt="wp_ss_20130101_0002" /></a><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/what-is-going-on-with-wp-discovery/wp_ss_20130101_0004/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/wp_ss_20130101_0004.jpg" alt="wp_ss_20130101_0004" /></a>.</p>

<h1>Update 16</h1>

<p>I have created a Twitter List of all the accounts that seemed to be caught up in the WP Discovery Incident.  NOTE: Some of these will be innocent by-standers in what WP Discovery were up to, but I have included all the ones that I was made aware of.  You can find this list <a href="https://twitter.com/gep13/wp-discovery-incident/members">here</a>.  If I have missed anyone, then please get in touch.</p>

<h1>Update 17</h1>

<p>Shortly after the above, Blockfall, the game that WP Discovery seemed to be advertising got in contact to say that they had written a <a href="http://areon-development.de/?p=191">blog post</a> on the subject.  The tweets that they sent out are shown below:</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> These screenshots were taken on Tuesday 1st January at the time shown in the screenshot, 23:12 GMT.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/what-is-going-on-with-wp-discovery/wp_ss_20130101_0006/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/wp_ss_20130101_0006.jpg" alt="wp_ss_20130101_0006" /></a><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/what-is-going-on-with-wp-discovery/wp_ss_20130101_0005/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/wp_ss_20130101_0005.jpg" alt="wp_ss_20130101_0005" /></a></p>

<p>These tweets linked to the <a href="http://areon-development.de/">Areon Development Website</a>, where they had created a <a href="http://areon-development.de/?p=191">blog post</a> on the topic, indicating that they had been in direct contact with WP Discovery, and had resulted in getting WP Discovery closed down.  In a short space of time, the blog post had changed slightly.  Both versions can be seen below:</p>

<h2>The Original Version</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/what-is-going-on-with-wp-discovery/wp_discovery_old/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/wp_discovery_old.jpg" alt="wp_discovery_old" /></a></p>

<h2>The Updated version:</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/what-is-going-on-with-wp-discovery/wp_discovery2/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/wp_discovery2.jpg" alt="wp_discovery2" /></a></p>

<h1>Update 18</h1>

<p>Craig Murphy (<a href="https://twitter.com/CAMURPHY">@CAMURPHY</a>) has written an excellent blog post on the subject of WP Discovery, focusing on what has happened, and what you can do to prevent yourself getting caught up in something like this again.  I recommend that you take a look at it.  You can find it <a href="http://www.craigmurphy.com/blog/?p=5586">here</a>.</p>

<h1>Update 19</h1>

<p>People seem to be getting the message.  I am happy to say that the number of followers that WP Discovery have seems to be finally going down.  See the following two screenshots:</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> These screenshots were taken on Tuesday 1st January at the time shown in the screenshot, 23:25 and  23:37 GMT respectively</p>

<h1><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/what-is-going-on-with-wp-discovery/wp_ss_20130101_0007/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/wp_ss_20130101_0007.jpg" alt="wp_ss_20130101_0007" /></a><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/what-is-going-on-with-wp-discovery/wp_ss_20130101_0008/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/wp_ss_20130101_0008.jpg" alt="wp_ss_20130101_0008" /></a></h1>

<h1></h1>

<p>Remember, at one point, WP Discovery had over 10000 followers.  Within the 12 minutes that elapsed in the screenshots above, WP Discovery also stopped following the 40 people that they had been following.</p>

<h1>Update 20</h1>

<p>Blockfall seem to have been very busy, they have posted to a PDF in which they show the communication history between themselves and WP Discovery.  They tweeted the existence of this PDF here:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Blockfall/status/286263981256105984">https://twitter.com/Blockfall/status/286263981256105984</a></p>

<p>In case this tweet goes away (Blockfall suggested already that they may delete it to stop spambots, you can see it here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/what-is-going-on-with-wp-discovery/2013-01-02_1156/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2013-01-02_1156.png" alt="2013-01-02_1156" /></a></p>

<p>The linked PDF can be found <a href="http://areon-development.de/press/AREON_LD00131.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<h1>Update 21</h1>

<p>I am VERY happy to announce that the WP Discovery Twitter account has now been closed!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/what-is-going-on-with-wp-discovery/2013-01-02_1133/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2013-01-02_1133.png" alt="2013-01-02_1133" /></a></p>

		<p>I hope that everyone has had a great Christmas, and are looking forward to celebrating at New Year.</p>

<p>In the downtime since finishing up work before Christmas, I have been working my way through my to do list, and one of them was to update the WordPress system that hosts this blog.  In doing so, it became clear that there were some &ldquo;issues&rdquo; with the WordPress installation which was hosted with my Web Host.  I tried for some while to get this resolved, and wasn&rsquo;t able to.  In the end, I decided to move the hosting of this WordPress blog to my own Virtual Private Server, that I have through <a href="http://tagadab.com/">Tagadab</a> (thanks again to <a href="http://twitter.com/agileguy">@agileguy</a> for the recommendation!).</p>

<p>This transfer has now been completed, and from what I can see, the blog seems to working correctly.  If you find any issues, then please feel free to get in touch, and I will get them corrected.</p>

		<h1>My Caliburn.Micro Talk at DDD North 2</h1>

<p>On Saturday 13th October 2012, I did a talk entitled &ldquo;Getting Started with Caliburn.Micro and Windows Phone 7&rdquo;. If you attended the session, and are interested in seeing either the slide deck, or the source code for the presentation, you can find this information below. If you did attend, let me say thank you very much, and I very much hope you enjoyed it!</p>

<h1>The Code</h1>

<p>All the demonstrations that I did during the presentation can be found on my GitHub account <a href="https://github.com/gep13/CaliburnMicroDemos">here</a>. I have created wiki pages for each demonstration that talk you through how to complete the demo, you can find them <a href="https://github.com/gep13/CaliburnMicroDemos/wiki">here</a>.</p>

<h1>The Slides</h1>

<p>A full copy of the slides that were used on the day can be found as an attachment to this post, and you can see a preview of them below:</p>

<p></p>

<h1>Feedback</h1>

<p>Since I am still reasonably new to doing public speaking, I would welcome any additional feedback that anyone has on my talk. If you have any comments about what I did wrong, what I did right, what could be improved upon etc, I would be very grateful to hear them.</p>
