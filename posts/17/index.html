	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/my-first-stylecop-presentation/" itemprop="url">My First StyleCop Presentation</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>On the 24th March 2011, I gave what I am considering to be my first “proper” community presentation at the <a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Home.aspx">Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23ADNUG">#ADNUG</a>). When the user group first started, I also did a presentation entitled <a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Meetings/Visual-Studio-2010---An-Introduction.aspx">“Visual Studio 2010 – An Introduction”</a>, but I regarded this as a demonstration of Visual Studio 2010, and the great tooling support that had been added to this release, rather than a full talk on a subject.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Meetings/StyleCop-Barriers-To-Entry.aspx">“StyleCop – Breaking down the barriers to entry”</a>.</p>

<p>I have been a long time advocate of StyleCop, and I was responsible for helping set this up within the development team that I am currently working in. In addition, I have been “toying” with the idea of getting into doing community speaking, and StyleCop seemed like a good entry point for this.</p>

<p>This talk was very much inspired by the excellent <a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/ddd9/ViewSession.aspx?SessionID=525">talk</a> that I saw by <a href="http://guysmithferrier.com/">Guy Smith-Ferrier</a> when I was at DDD9 in January. However, I tried to take it a little bit further and explain the real world hurdles that stands in the way of a development team implementing StyleCop in their applications, drawing on the problems that I had personally faced in implementing StyleCop in my team.</p>

<p>On the night, I am happy to say that I think the talk went down really well, although there were a couple fumbles as I tried to remember the order that my slides were in, and the demo where I tried to debug a custom StyleCop rule using two instances of Visual Studio didn’t want to work <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/wlEmoticon-sadsmile.png" alt="Sad smile" />. If you attended the talk, I would be very interested to hear any feedback that you have, good and bad. This is the only way in which I can get better.</p>

<p>I am also happy to say that this was the first night where I was able to give away lots of <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=107">swag</a> to the User Group members, and this will continue for the foreseeable future, with hopefully more prizes being added as we go.</p>

<p>A big thanks has to go to Emma for the lend of her hat for drawing the names for the prizes! I am going to have to sort out a proper way of doing this for the next meeting (but just in case, if you could bring your hat again, that would be great!!). If anyone has any novel ideas about how we can auction off these prizes, then feel free to let me know.</p>

<p>The slides from my presentation can be found <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/StyleCop-Breaking-down-the-barriers-to-entry.pdf">here</a>, and the demo code that I used can be found <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/StyleCop-Breaking-down-the-barriers-to-entry-Demos.zip">here</a>. If you have any questions, then please feel free to <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?page_id=38">get in touch</a>!</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/a-tool-to-synchronise-visual-studio-2010-extensions/" itemprop="url">A Tool to Synchronise Visual Studio 2010 Extensions</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>A while back on Twitter I was having a conversation with Paul Stack (@stack72), in which Paul suggested that there was a fundamental ability missing from the Visual Studio 2010 Extension Manager. Namely, the ability to synchronise Extensions across multiple Visual Studio 2010 instances. The upshot of this conversation was a blog post from Paul which you can see <a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/post/Visual-Studio-2010-Extension-Required.aspx">here</a>.</p>

<p>Moving forward a month, I got another Tweet from Paul saying that he has solved this problem with the help of Latish Sehgal (@Latish) and his ExtensionSync Visual Studio 2010 Extension. You can find Paul’s blog post about this <a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/post/Finally-a-Visual-Studio-Extension-Sync-Tool.aspx">here</a>, and more information on Latish’s blog <a href="http://dotnetsurfers.com/blog/2011/03/14/extensionsync-a-visual-studio-extension-to-synchronize-other-extensions/">here</a>.</p>

<p>As soon as I heard about this, I immediately set about getting this installed, and tested between Visual Studio 2010 on my work machine, and Visual Studio 2010 on my home machine. I am happy to say that “it just worked!”</p>

<p>The only difference in my setup, compared to the example in Latish’s video, I am using Live Mesh to do the sync’ing, rather than DropBox. However, as long as you can get the settings file “shared” between the two machines, there is no reason why you can’t get this working, even if that means emailing the file to your other machine.</p>

<p>With all that set up and running, I thought my work was done. However, after another conversation with Paul, again via the medium of Twitter (I think I might be addicted to that now), I realised that I had missed a trick!!</p>

<p>This extension, not only provided me with the ability to synchronise my own extensions, but it also provided the ability to synchronise the extensions that are used within a team of developers. At the minute, I am in the process of upgrading a Visual Studio 2008 solution into Visual Studio 2010, and once that is complete, I will be rolling out a base Visual Studio 2010 Virtual Machine for all the developers to use. Out of the box, I can make sure that each Virtual Machine has the same extensions, but what if new ones come out that each developer should have?</p>

<p>Sure, I could send out an email to everyone to say, “<em>get this extension installed</em>”, but it would just be plain simpler if that happened automatically. That way, I can ensure a consistent development environment across all the development machines.</p>

<p>So, with this in mind, I set up a mapped drive on a common server that each Virtual Machine will be able to hit, and I configured ExtensionSync to use this mapped drive, and again “it just worked!”.</p>

<p>A big thanks to Latish for creating this Extension, and to Paul for the ideas!!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Out of the box, Visual Studio offers up the ability to compare and merge files. This ability is invaluable when you are trying to check something in, and there have been changes since you last checked in and you need to merge the changes, or you want to look at the differences in a file between check ins.</p>

<p>However, it has been my experience that the built in tools are just not that great, and there are better tools out there. My tools of choice are <a href="http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/">kdiff</a> and <a href="http://winmerge.org/">winmerge</a>.</p>

<p>The good news is that with a few simple steps, these tools can be added into the Visual Studio configuration so that the built in operations of comparing and merging use these tools, rather than the built in ones.</p>

<p><strong>Note: I am assuming that you are using Visual Studio 2010 and Visual Studio Team Foundation Server as your Source Control Provider and Windows 7 64 Bit Edition. If you are using anything other than this, the screenshots and the paths to executables may be different.</strong></p>

<p>Follow these steps to configure this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Install WinMerge</p></li>
<li><p>Install KDIff3</p></li>
<li><p>Open Visual Studio 2010</p></li>
<li><p>Select Tools | Options and in the tree, select “Source Control”</p></li>
<li><p>Change the &ldquo;Current source control plug-in&rdquo; DropDownList to be &ldquo;Visual Studio Team Foundation Server&rdquo;</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p>Select &ldquo;Visual Studio Team Foundation Server&rdquo; in the tree under &ldquo;Source Control&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>Click the &ldquo;Configure User Tools…&rdquo; button</p></li>

<p>I have just secured my place at the upcoming DDD Scotland Event, which is taking place at the Glasgow Caledonian University on Saturday, 7th May 2011. If you haven’t already done so, you can register for the event <a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/scotland2011/Register.aspx">here</a>.</p>

<p>There were some VERY interesting sessions proposed for the day long activities (5 tracks, with 5 sessions in each), which you can see <a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/scotland2011/ProposedSessions.aspx">here</a>, but the final list of chosen sessions can be found <a href="http://scottishdevelopers.com/2011/03/14/ddd-scotland-2011-agenda/">here</a>. I have been reliably informed by @argibson that this list will make it onto the main <a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/scotland2011/Default.aspx">DDD Scotland site</a> once the final confirmations have been received from the speakers. The hard part now is to decide what sessions I want to attend!!</p>

<p>Hot on the heels of <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=28">DDD9</a>, I am very much looking forward to attending DDD Scotland, and I would highly recommend everyone to attend.</p>

<p>In addition to the 5 main tracks, there are rumours circulating about a 6th, “alternative”, track in the planning stages, which I am very interested to hear more about.</p>

<p>Keep up the good work guys!!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Yesterday I found out that there was a new version of the DSM (DiskStation Manager) for my <a href="http://www.synology.com/enu/products/DS410/index.php">Synology DS410 Server</a>, so after downloading the correct version (I incorrectly downloaded the DSM for the <a href="http://www.synology.com/enu/products/DS1511+/index.php">DS1511+</a>, if only I could afford one of those!!), I set about installing it.</p>

<p>I have always been a little bit worried about doing one of these upgrades. I am using the Synology Server as the main location for basically all of my files, so if something were to go wrong during the upgrade I would be at a loss for a while until I put everything back together.</p>

<p>On the bright side, Synology are VERY good at what they do, and I am happy to report that the installation of DSM 3.1-1594 went off without any problems!</p>

<p>This update brings a redesign to the following packages to provide an easy-to-use experience:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Download Station 3</p></li>
<li><p>Audio Station 3</p></li>
<li><p>Photo Station</p></li>
<li><p>Surveillance Station</p></li>
</ul>


<p>In addition, there is a brand new Mail Station 2 package to provide multiple SMTP Servers, and multiple email account fetching. Recently, I have moved away from trying to host my own mail server, as I found it just too much work for little reward, however, I may have to re-think this given this new offering!</p>

<p>The best feature for me though would have to be the “Auto DSM Update”. This will save a lot of hassle and concern, by allowing the Synology Server to maintain itself.</p>

<p>I am still VERY tempted to play with the <a href="http://www.synology.com/enu/products/features/live_view.php">Surveillance Station</a>. I don’t have a network camera just now, but I have just found out that you can use the <a href="http://forum.synology.com/wiki/index.php/Surveillance_Station_-_Using_DS_cam">DS Cam application</a> on an iPhone/Android enabled phone, so I think the wife&rsquo;s phone phone might be getting a work out soon!!</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/too-much-security-or-not-enough/" itemprop="url">Too Much Security, or Not Enough?</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>In today’s Internet focused world, how much security do you need in order to be “safe”?</p>

<p>I went through a stage of being VERY paranoid about having everything from anti-virus, to anti-spyware, to anti-malware, to anti-freeze, running on my computer. Over the years, I have mellowed slightly, and don’t have as many packages running as I once did, but I still have a few.</p>

<p>On my Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit edition, (in no particular order), I have:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The built in Windows 7 <strong>Firewall. </strong>I used to use the free ZoneAlarm Firewall, but with the release of Windows 7, and it’s improved Firewall capabilities, I decided to retire ZoneAlarm</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.javacoolsoftware.com/spywareblaster.html">Spyware Blaster</a> – A very light weight package designed to prevent the installation of Spyware and other unwanted software</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/">Microsoft Security Essentials</a> – I used to use a combination of AVG Free Edition and SpyBot Search and Destroy to cover the needs of Virus and Spyware Protection, but I have found that this package is up to both tasks. Very simple and easy to use, and updates simply come down as part of Windows Update</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/">Malwarebytes</a> – Recently I have seen a number of Malware attacks that I have only been able to automatically remove using this package, and as a result, it has made it onto my list of packages to install on a new build.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>In addition to the typical “run-time” applications, I also use the following package to make sure that my machine is performing at an optimum level:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner">CCleaner</a> – A weekly scan with this package helps to keep my pc “clean”</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.auslogics.com/en/software/disk-defrag/">Auslogics Disk Defrag</a> – A weekly scan with this package helps of make sure that my drive is running at it’s best</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Have I missed anything? Is there anything that my computer is still vulnerable to? The combination of the above packages has been honed over a good number of years of trying to fix other peoples computers, but I am curious to know if there is anything that I have missed.</p>
