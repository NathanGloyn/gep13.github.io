		<p>Like most geeks, I have both a desktop PC and a laptop (if I am being honest, I also have a NetBook as well). From time to time, I will be using these at the same time. Whether it is to do the monthly virus scans and updates, or whether it is transferring files between the two, etc.</p>

<p>Before finding “<a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/next/archive/2011/09/09/microsoft-garage-download-mouse-without-borders.aspx">Mouse without Borders</a>” it was a case of switching between the keyboard and mouse of my desktop, over to the keyboard and track pad of the laptop, but no more! Now I just use the same keyboard and mouse, and I get a flawless transition between each desktop.</p>

<p>Once setup, you can position tell “<a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/next/archive/2011/09/09/microsoft-garage-download-mouse-without-borders.aspx">Mouse without Borders</a>” how you want your machines configured, I have mine setup as follows:</p>

<p>and there are a host of options that you can configure:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/image1.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/image_thumb1.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>There are other products on the market that do a similar job, for instance <a href="http://www.inputdirector.com/">InputDirector</a>, but I have never tried this software.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Back in February, I bought myself a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B002LVUWFE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B002LVUWFE">Kindle</a> and I blogged about it <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=93">here</a>. I have been very happy with it, and through some cracking deals at the likes of <a href="http://oreilly.com/">O’Reilly</a> and <a href="http://www.manning.com/">Manning Publications</a> I now have an extensive set of technical books on the Kindle. Now all I need is time to read them all <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/wlEmoticon-smile1.png" alt="Smile" />.</p>

<p>So, what is the problem?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0051QVF7A/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B0051QVF7A"><img src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.co.uk/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;Format=_SL110_&amp;ASIN=B0051QVF7A&amp;MarketPlace=GB&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822" alt="" /></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=www6thprimeco-21&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B0051QVF7A" alt="" /></p>

<p>Well, a colleague at work has just bought the new shiny <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0051QVF7A/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B0051QVF7A">Kindle</a>, pictured to the left, and I am jealous <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/wlEmoticon-sadsmile1.png" alt="Sad smile" />. It is a cracking piece of kit. In terms of screen real estate, it is exactly the same as the Kindle that I have, but the lack of the physical keyboard and smaller bevel around the outside, means that it is a much smaller device, and also lighter.</p>

<p>I thought that the lack of physical keyboard would bother me, but realistically, the only time that I use the keyboard is to enter the password to unlock the device, and that is it. Although a little bit of a pain to navigate an on-screen keyboard with the directional pad, it isn’t the end of the world.</p>

<p>So now the next question, do I flog my Kindle on eBay and get a new one? Or do I wait and see when the Kindle Touch will land in the UK? Do I even need touch screen for the Kindle? Questions, Questions Questions!</p>

<p>Anyone want an older model Kindle?</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/enough-is-enough-time-to-get-fit/" itemprop="url">Enough Is Enough! Time to Get Fit!</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Once upon a time, I used to actually be quite a fit and healthy guy. I did a lot of running, competed in a 10K, and went on a trek along the Great Wall of China. However, recently, all of that seems to have been forgotten and replaced with little or no exercise, and bad eating habits!</p>

<p>Well, all of that has got to change! I am now officially on a diet, and back at the gym.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000FMQ296/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B000FMQ296"><img src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.co.uk/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;Format=_SL110_&amp;ASIN=B000FMQ296&amp;MarketPlace=GB&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822" alt="" /></a></p>

<p><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=www6thprimeco-21&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B000FMQ296" alt="" /></p>

<p>This new endeavour wouldn’t be the same unless there was a least some amount of technology involved, so let me present to you the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000FMQ296/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B000FMQ296">Garmin Forerunner 305</a>. This little beauty, which is both a Heart Rate Monitor (via a chest strap) and GPS Recorder, is going to help me track how well/badly I am improving.</p>

<p>Quite simply this device “just works”. I have used it twice now, once to go for a hike up <a href="http://connect.garmin.com/activity/119878884#.TpBlRXjlwVE.twitter">Bennachie</a> and the other a simple walk around the <a href="http://connect.garmin.com/activity/120403009#.TpLNirc41VE.facebook">village</a>. And both times it has tracked me perfectly, with one exception when it claimed that my heart rate was 135% of my maximum heart rate, but I think that this was due to the chest strap not being tight enough.</p>

<p>Following these “tests” I will then be using the device to track the workouts that I do at the gym. Mostly this will be on the treadmill doing a Cardio Workout, but I will also be doing some interval training on the bike (not looking forward to that <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/wlEmoticon-sadsmile.png" alt="Sad smile" />).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000UO61HC/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B000UO61HC"><img src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.co.uk/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;Format=_SL110_&amp;ASIN=B000UO61HC&amp;MarketPlace=GB&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822" alt="" /></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=www6thprimeco-21&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B000UO61HC" alt="" /></p>

<p>One thing that I think I will add is the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000UO61HC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B000UO61HC">Garmin Foot Pod</a> which I can use when I am running indoors, where the GPS is essentially useless.</p>

<p>All in all, I am looking forward to getting back to the same level of fitness that I once had, and as an incentive, I am looking into competing in the <a href="http://www.wildheartsinaction.org/santa_run">Aberdeen Santa Run</a>, I just need to convince some work colleagues/friends that this is a good idea <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" /></p>

<p>Before deciding on the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000FMQ296/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B000FMQ296">ForeRunner 305</a>, I looked at a number of other devices, including the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B003EGC47Y/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B003EGC47Y">ForeRunner 110</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0025UHKNS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B0025UHKNS">ForeRunner 405CX</a>, but I decided that although a little bit “clunkier”, the 305 offered more options in terms of display, so for me, it was the better choice.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/progressive-net-tutorials-a-review-skillsmatter-prognet11/" itemprop="url">Progressive .Net Tutorials – a Review @skillsmatter #prognet11</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Sadly, the Progressive .Net Tutorials 2011 have come to an end, but I am happy to report that I have had a great time. The quality and content of the sessions has been amazing, and the guys at Skills Matter do a great job in making sure that everything ticked over correctly.</p>

<p>A big congratulations has to go to everyone at Skills Matter! Thank you!</p>

<p>The thing that I really liked about the Progressive .Net Tutorials is the extended time of the sessions. Each session ran for almost 4 hours. This meant that you had plenty of time to digest the content of the presentation, and if required, to ask questions. In the case of the final session on the 3rd day, you were actually given time to try out the products that were being presented. This was great as it meant you got some time to “play” and if you had any questions, you could ask the experts in the room.</p>

<p>The other thing that I was amazed at was the speed at which Skills Matter were able to turn around the videos of the sessions. Before the end of the day, the video for the morning session was available to watch on their site. Truly amazing!! Now what I need to do is find some time to watch the videos for the sessions that I was not able to attend <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/35aceb50ed2b_AF56/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" />.</p>

<p>For a round up of each of the sessions that I attended you can take a look at the following links:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=361">Day 1 - Morning Session</a> - Ian Cooper and Sebastian Lambla.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=362">Day 1 - Afternoon Session</a> - Dylan Beattie.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=363">Day 2 - Morning Session</a> – Simon Brown</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=364">Day 2 - Afternoon Session</a> – Paul Stack</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=365">Day 3 - Morning Session</a> – Jon Skeet</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=372">Day 3 - Afternoon Session</a> – Mark Rendle and Steven Robbins</p>

<p>So, the real question, would I attend the Progressive .Net Tutorials in 2012?</p>

<p>The answer?</p>

<p>Quite simply…</p>

<p><strong><strong>YES! Highly recommended to everyone!</strong></strong></p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I had a lot of trouble deciding on the final session of the final day at the Progressive .Net Tutorials. The choice was between Nathan Gloyn (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/nathangloyn">@nathangloyn</a>) and his “<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/ajax-ria/you-think-you-know-agile">You think you know agile?</a>” and the “<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/ajax-ria/introduction-to-nancy-and-simple-data">Introduction to Nancy and Simple.Data</a>” talk featuring Mark Rendle (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/markrendle">@markrendle</a>) and Steven Robbins (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/grumpydev">@grumpydev</a>).</p>

<p>Why the debate? Well, let me tell you…</p>

<p>We have recently tried and failed to implement an Agile approach in a project, so I am fairly sure that we will not be using an Agile approach for the foreseeable future. Coupled with the fact that I have seen an earlier Kanban talk from Nathan, initially I was leaning towards Mark and Steven’s session. In addition, in a recent blog <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=313">post</a> I talked about how is was striving to becoming a better developer and in order to do this I feel I need to learn more languages and frameworks, and the Nancy and Simple.Data talk seemed to fit that bill perfectly.</p>

<p>In the end, I opted to attend the Nancy and Simple.Data talk (sorry Nathan <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/beed2e344009_119E0/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" />)</p>

<p>This session was split straight down the middle. The first half was devoted to an introduction to both Nancy and Simple.Data, and the second half was handed over to the delegates to create a sample “To Do” application. This format worked really well. It gave me the opportunity to directly apply what we had been told about, with the benefit of having Mark and Steven in the room, if there were any questions.</p>

<p>What struck me immediately about both packages is how quickly you can get up and running with both of them. There are NuGet packages available for both and each one are split into a number of smaller packages so that you can only take what you need.</p>

<p>For instance:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>install-package Nancy.Hosting.Self</p></li>
<li><p>install-package Nancy.Hosting.AspNet</p></li>
<li><p>install-package Nancy.Hosting.Wcf</p></li>
<li><p>install-package Nancy.Hosting.Owin</p></li>
<li><p>install-package Nancy.Viewengines.Razor</p></li>
<li><p>install-package Nancy.Authentication.Forms</p></li>
</ul>


<p>And:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>install-package Simple.Data.SqlServer</p></li>
<li><p>install-package Simple.Data.SqlCompact40</p></li>
<li><p>install-package Simple.Data.Core</p></li>
<li><p>install-package Simple.Data.Mysql</p></li>
</ul>


<p>This is a prime example of the packaging that was described in the <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=361">first session on Monday</a>.</p>

<p>Once the core packages were installed:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>install-package Nancy.Hosting.AspNet</p></li>
<li><p>install-package Simple.Data.SqlServer</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Getting a basic website up and running is as simple as:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; Hello : NancyModule
    {
        &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; Hello()
        {
            Get[&lt;span class="str"&gt;"/"&lt;/span&gt;] = _ =&gt; &lt;span class="str"&gt;"Hello World!"&lt;/span&gt;;
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>And:</p>

<pre><code>        &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; Main(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;[] args)
        {
            var db = Database.OpenNamedConnection(&lt;span class="str"&gt;"prognet”&lt;/span&gt;);
            var hello = db.Hello.FindById(1);
            Console.WriteLine(&lt;span class="str"&gt;"{0} {1}!"&lt;/span&gt;, hello.Greeting, hello.Subject);
        }
</code></pre>

<p>Simples!</p>

<p>With this fully discussed, Mark then showed a more fully functional sample in the form of his “Heckle” application which you can find linked below.</p>

<p>Speaking to Mark after the session the one problem that I had was, I couldn’t see past how you actually use Nancy and Simple.Data in a “proper” application. By that I mean an application that fully separates the layers/tiers, UI, BLL and DAL, etc. Mark pointed me at <a href="https://github.com/ToJans/NerdBeers">NerdBeers</a> which I am going to have to take a look at, as I think it will go along way to cement my understanding.</p>

<p>All in all, a great session that seemed to be enjoyed by all!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>First up on this last day of the Progressive .Net Tutorials was Jon Skeet (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jonskeet">@jonskeet</a>) and his “<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/ajax-ria/async-methods-in-c-sharp-5-2389">Async Methods in C# 5</a>” talk.</p>

<p>Like Paul Stacks talk yesterday, this was a very well attended talk, and rightly so.  I had never seen a Jon Skeet presentation before but I have heard him on various pod casts and videos, but he is a great presenter who has a natural talent at explaining complicated scenarios in a easy to understand way.</p>

<p>Jon started out with some very impressive slides (a example of which can be seen <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/archive/2011/05/08/eduasync-part-1-introduction.aspx">here</a>) and explained the “asynchronous” techniques that have been used to date in earlier versions of the framework:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>BeginFoo</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Callback</p>

<ul>
<li>EndFoo</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>OnSuccess</p></li>
<li><p>OnError</p>

<ul>
<li>Go!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>And then began explaining what awaits (do you like my pun? <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/184b90d28369_BB7D/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" />) us in C# 5.</p>

<p>I have to say that the usage of the async and await keywords is very appealing, and it is reasonably easy to see how it could be applied in a code base.</p>

<p>Following this, Jon then went onto discuss his Eduasync sample code which, rather than using the Microsoft Visual Studio Async CTP, re-writes the implementation.  Although it was interesting to see how all the pieces fit together, Jon did make clear that it is unlikely that you would ever need to write any code like this, but rather it was just “fun” to do.</p>

<p>At the end of the talk I can honestly say that my head hurts!  I went into this talk having never played with the Parallel Extension in .Net 4.0 and having read hardly anything C# 5 Async, and although I got “some” of the concepts, I would still have a lot to learn.  This is really something that I would need to place with in anger in order to concrete my understandings.  The first port of call will be to go back and read Jon’s series to blog posts <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/archive/tags/Eduasync/default.aspx">here</a>.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>In the afternoon it was the turn of Paul Stack (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/stack72">@stack72</a>) and his “<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/ci-to-cd">Continuous Integration to Continuous Delivery</a>”</p>

<p>I was expecting a lot from this session, and I am happy to say that I was not disappointed!</p>

<p>I have seen Paul’s Continuous Integration talk before, and I was very curious to see how you would transition from Continuous Integration to Continuous Delivery/Continuous Deployment.</p>

<p>Paul went on to explain that the core practices of Continuous Delivery break down as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Continuous Integration</p></li>
<li><p>Configuration Management</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Dependencies</p></li>
<li><p>Documentation</p></li>
<li><p>Environment</p></li>
<li><p>App Configurations</p></li>
<li><p>Data</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Tests</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Unit</p></li>
<li><p>Integration</p></li>
<li><p>Functional/Acceptance</p></li>
<li><p>Performance/Load</p></li>
<li><p>Penetration</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Now, getting all these things in place is no small task, and it is only something that can be achieved over a period of time, it is not going to happen over night. However, once you have it in place, you can build and deploy (as Paul showed) your web application to a web server in a matter of seconds. When you sit and think about this, this is actually very impressive!  When I saw this in action, something suddenly clicked with me. It was the separation of the build and test build configuration and the deploy build configuration. What this meant is that you can have your Continuous Integration build running which prepares the package ready for deployment (which can run every time you check in some code) and another build configuration which is responsible for doing the actual deployment. Clever!  Paul then when on to discuss what turned into a very hot topic, namely Feature Switching. Paul contends that the strategy of using Feature Branching ultimately leads to a number of time consuming merging of the source code (perhaps not as hard when using Distributed Source Control) which could be avoided with the use of toggling features on and off when required. Having thought about it, and listened to the discussion that came from it, it is hard to argue. For more information on the subject, have a look at Martin Fowlers blog post <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureToggle.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Again, another great session, and I am very much looking forward to tomorrow.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>The second day of the Progressive .Net Tutorials got off to a flying start thanks to Simon Brown (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/simonbrown">@simonbrown</a>) and his “<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/load-testing-for-developers">Load Testing for Developers</a>” session.</p>

<p>First up, I have to give Simon a lot of credit for his preparation for this talk. His <a href="http://www.codingthearchitecture.com/2011/08/25/load_testing_for_developers.html">blog post</a> clearly listed all the requirements for his very interactive session. This included getting the source code for the application that was being tested, the load testing tool (<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/jmeter/">jmeter</a>) that we were going to be exercising, as well as his slide deck.</p>

<p>Interestingly, his slide deck was in the form of an <a href="http://www.evernote.com/">Evernote</a> notebook, which as well as having the standard slides, also had a set of exercises that were to be completed during the course of this presentation. Normally when I am in a session like this, I fire open <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-gb/onenote/">OneNote</a> and take notes in there, but for the sake of this session, I closed OneNote <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Day-2--Morning-Session-prognet11-skillsm_BEDE/wlEmoticon-sadsmile.png" alt="Sad smile" />. I have to say though, I was impressed with Evernote. I don’t think I will being switching any time soon, but it was very good.</p>

<p>Now, onto the actual content of the session….</p>

<p>I have to say that I was very impressed with the session. Now, I have never done any form of Load Testing, and I was worried that in order to do any there would be this convoluted process to put all the pieces in the right place and get it all working, but this is simply not the case.</p>

<p>After a couple setup steps, jmeter was in a position to record the steps of a simple login process to the sample web application.</p>

<p>From there, the rest of the session centred around extending the simple log in test script to include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>more users</p></li>
<li><p>parameterised request</p></li>
<li><p>regular expression extraction of parameters</p></li>
<li><p>running in head less mode</p></li>
<li><p>logging the output of the test to file</p></li>
</ul>


<p>With all of these things in place it is a small jump to see how you could include these into a Continuous Integration cycle, to get immediate feedback on how your site is reacting to the load testing.</p>

<p>Simon did make a distinction between Load Testing and Integration Testing. Although you “could” use jmeter to do rudimentary Integration Testing, there are other tools on the market that do a better job of this, such as <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a> and <a href="http://cukes.info/">Cucumber</a>. The take away from this was use each tool for what it is designed for.</p>

<p>Simon also mentioned that he is away to open source a tool that will help with the parsing of the output from jmeter. I am going to be very interested to see when this is open sourced as I think I am going to make use of jmeter in an upcoming project.</p>

<p>All in all, a great session!</p>
