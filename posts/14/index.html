	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Last week I purchased my shiny new NetBook. I opted for the <a href="http://www.asus.com/Eee/Eee_PC/Eee_PC_1015PX/">ASUS Eee PC 1015PX</a> which you can see pictured below.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/56-2.jpg"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/56-2_thumb.jpg" alt="56 (2)" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/55-2.jpg"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/55-2_thumb.jpg" alt="55 (2)" /></a></p>

<p>The reason that I decided to get a NetBook is due to the amount of travelling that I have been doing lately. With each trip I was taking along my <a href="http://www.dell.com/us/p/studio-1558/pd">Dell Studio 1558</a>, which although not a massive laptop, does become rather cumbersome to move around after a while. In addition, when away on a trip I typically only used the laptop to check email, and write the odd blog post, so there really was no “need” to take the laptop, a NetBook would easily be able to do those things, plus a lot more.</p>

<p>I had a hard time deciding which NetBook I wanted to get, and I was toying with the idea of getting the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/NP-NC210-A03UK-Non-Gloss-Backlight-Graphics-Accelerator/dp/B004P9LGHI">Samsung NP-NC210</a> which has had a number of good reviews lately. However, when travelling through Birmingham Airport on my way back from the .Net Community Leaders Day I spotted this ASUS. I hadn’t looked specifically at this model (as it is a slightly older version), however, a quick Google determined that it to had reviewed a number of awards. Throw in the fact that it was on a “Managers Special” deal, I decided to get it.</p>

<p>So far, I have not been at all disappointed with the purchase, it does “exactly what it says on the tin”. I spent the weekend getting it set up, various applications, virus/spyware, etc, and so far it has eaten all of that up quite nicely. It also has the ability to dual boot into a Linux OS that basically has a web browser and a few other features, so assuming that all I want to do is surf the web, booting into this OS takes only a few seconds, which is quite a nice feature to have.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/becoming-a-better-developer/" itemprop="url">Becoming a Better Developer…</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>While I was at <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=278">DDD South West</a> I had the pleasure of listening to a number of 20-20 presentations (20 slides, each one timed to last 20 seconds) and one that really stood out for me was <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/markrendle">Mark Rendle’s</a> “Kaizen For Coders”.</p>

<p>I have now had the chance to listen back to this presentation thanks for <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/guysmithferrier">Guy Smith-Ferrier</a>, who has downloads of four out of the six 20-20 presentations available on his <a href="http://guysmithferrier.com/post/2011/07/DDD-South-West-3-On-The-Day.aspx">blog</a>. I would highly encourage everyone to take 6 minutes and 40 seconds out of their day to watch this presentation.</p>

<p><em>NOTE: For those who are easily offended, there is one section where Mark let’s out a swear word.</em></p>

<p>In this presentation, Mark summarises a number of things that developers can be doing to improve themselves, some of which I was already doing, but others that I wasn’t, and it has made me stop and think about how I can improve myself as a developer.</p>

<p>Some of the main points of the presentation were:</p>

<blockquote>  
> 
>    
> 
> “Learn something new every day”
> 
>    
> 
> </blockquote>


<p>I am finding that I am doing this more and more now. Now, this might sound a little bit weird, but it’s true. I have been developing in .Net for around 8 years now, and it is only lately that I feel I am truly, regularly, learning new things. I don’t know if this is as a result of my increased involvement in the .Net Community, or whether data is simply more readily available, through mediums such as Twitter, but it is happening. It is all too easy to become complacent about things, but going out of your way to learn new things is a great way to inject some life back into your development.</p>

<blockquote>  
> 
>    
> 
> “Always, always be learning a new language”
> 
>    
> 
> </blockquote>


<p>Now this is something that I don’t do, but something that I am looking to change. I guess you could say that I am “stuck in a rut” in this regard. During my time as a .Net Developer I have done both Windows and Web Development, using both VB.Net and C#, and over the years I have picked up other things like SharePoint and Silverlight, but predominantly, this has all been using C#. In order to become a more “rounded” developer it is clear to me now that I have to start learning other languages and frameworks. The problem that I now face is deciding on which ones, as there are quite a lot out there!</p>

<blockquote>  
> 
>    
> 
> “Possibly the most important part of this entire presentation, read books!”
> 
>    
> 
> </blockquote>


<p>My work colleagues will testify to the fact that I have this one covered! I own a lot of books, and since purchasing my <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=93">Kindle</a>, I now own a few more. The problem here, as Mark points out, is that it is not enough just to own books, you also have to read them to. For a while there I was guilty of doing that, buying a book and never reading it, but I have learnt the error of my ways.</p>

<blockquote>  
> 
>    
> 
> “Listen to podcasts”
> 
>    
> 
> </blockquote>


<p>Again, this is something that I haven’t done a lot of, but I have now started listening to a few on the commute to work. At the minute, this consists of the likes of <a href="http://thisdeveloperslife.com/">This Developer’s Life</a>, <a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/">Hanselminutes</a>, and <a href="http://wpdevpodcast.com/">Windows Phone Dev Podcast</a>. Since I am new to this podcast “thing” I would welcome any additional recommendations.</p>

<blockquote>  
> 
>    
> 
> “Read code”
> 
>    
> 
> </blockquote>


<p>This is also not something that I have done a lot of. When I was first getting into ASP.Net development I used the original <a href="http://thebeerhouse.codeplex.com/releases/view/127">BeerHouse sample kit</a> for ASP.Net 2.0 which I still believe to be a great example of N-Tier application development, however, since then, I haven’t really “read” any other code samples. Again, this is something that I aim to change going forward. With open source repositories such as GitHub and BitBucket, there is plenty of code out there to take a look at.</p>

<blockquote>  
> 
>    
> 
> “Be prepared to invest some money in this process… you are a commodity, and you need to make sure that you maintain yourself as a commodity”
> 
>    
> 
> </blockquote>


<p>For me, this was the defining point of the presentation, and one that really resounded with me. Now obviously it isn’t always possible to fork out loads of money to keep up to date with the latest technologies, however, I think it is fair to say that you need to invest something; be it time or money.</p>

<p>This could be the travelling costs to get to free conferences such as those from DDD, or something simpler like getting involved in your local .Net User Group, you need to do it.</p>

<p>With this in mind, I have now made the decision to attend the <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event/open-source-dot-net/progressive-dot-net-tutorials-2011">Progressive .Net Tutorials</a> in London in September. I have never attended anything like this, but I was very intrigued by the offer of 4-hour in depth tutorials, and having looked at the session list, I decided that it was too good an opportunity to miss!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Hot on the heels of the <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=310">announcement</a> from #DDDNorth that they are accepting submissions from potential speakers, I have just found out the #DDDBelfast are doing the same <a href="http://www.developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/dddie11/">thing</a>.</p>

<p>This conference is set to take place on Saturday 1st October 2011 at the University of Ulster.</p>

<p>For the same reason that I will not be able to attend #DDDNorth, I will also not be able to attend #DDDBelfast, which is a great shame as I would have loved to attend.</p>

<p>October is shaping up to be a very busy month for conferences/events:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Saturday 1st October: DDD Belfast</p></li>
<li><p>Saturday 8th October: DDD North</p></li>
<li><p>Friday 21st to Sunday 23rd October: GiveCamp UK
Throw into the mix the fact that the <a href="http://www.buildwindows.com">Microsoft BUILD conference</a> is going to be held on Tuesday 12th September and you can see that there is a lot of stuff happening in the near future <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/wlEmoticon-smile1.png" alt="Smile" />  As someone who likes to try to attend all conferences and events in order to learn as much as I possibly can, I do think that 3 events back to back in October might be a little bit too much. It might perhaps be better to space these out so that there is only 1 per month, but at the same time, given that these events are put on free for the community, we really can’t complain too much.</p></li>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>In case you hadn’t heard the DDD Conference, which this year has visited <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=28">Reading</a>, <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=210">Glasgow</a> and <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=278">Bristol</a>, is now coming to <a href="http://www.developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/north/Default.aspx">Sunderland</a>. This is going to take place on Saturday 8th October 2011, at the University of Sunderland.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I am not going to be able to make it to this event, I have already committed to going to <a href="http://www.givecamp.org.uk/">GiveCamp UK</a> later in October, and I can’t make both. However, if it is anything like the other DDD Conferences then I would highly recommend that you go along!!</p>

<p>Registration for the event is not open yet, however, they are accepting submissions for speakers on the day, so if you have a topic that you want to talk about, now is your chance to get a foot in the door.</p>

<p>To find out more information about the event check out the <a href="http://www.developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/north/Default.aspx">website</a> or you can follow <a href="http://twitter.com/dddnorth">@DDDNorth</a>, or you can use the #DDDNorth hash tag.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/all-in-one-code-framework/" itemprop="url">All-In-One Code Framework</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>This afternoon, while trying to find a sample that would help me create a Shell Extension for Windows Explorer, I stumbled across the All-In-One Code Framework on CodePlex:</p>

<p><a href="http://1code.codeplex.com/">http://1code.codeplex.com/</a></p>

<p>This is not something that I had heard of before, and the initial description of the project warranted some more investigation:</p>

<blockquote>  
> 
>    
> 
>     
>   * Are you frustrated by the lack of code samples for a certain programming task? 
>      
>   * Have you ever struggled to quickly get started with a technique? 
>      
>   * Have you expected someone to write code samples for you based on your requests for free? 
>      
>   * Is a one-stop code sample library for all Microsoft development technologies attractive to you?
>       
> 
> If your answer is YES to any of these questions, the Microsoft All-In-One Code Framework is for you!
> 
>    
> 
> </blockquote>


<p>After watching the introduction video <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Visual-Studio-Toolbox/Visual-Studio-Toolbox-All-In-One-Code-Framework">here</a>, I decided to get it installed.</p>

<p>There are two ways that you can use it, either as a <a href="http://1code.codeplex.com/releases/view/64539">standalone application</a> or as a <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/4934b087-e6cc-44dd-b992-a71f00a2a6df">Visual Studio 2010 Extension</a>. Due to the fact that the sample application is intended for use with the Express Editions of Visual Studio and because I am a hoarder of <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=3">Visual Studio Extensions</a>, I opted to install the Extension.</p>

<p>With this installed, you have two ways to access the available sample applications. The first is from the Tools Menu:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/All-In-Code-Framework_12560/All-In-One-Code-1.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/All-In-Code-Framework_12560/All-In-One-Code-1_thumb.png" alt="All In One Code 1" /></a></p>

<p>Clicking on this brings up this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/All-In-Code-Framework_12560/All-In-One-Code-3.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/All-In-Code-Framework_12560/All-In-One-Code-3_thumb.png" alt="All In One Code 3" /></a></p>

<p>Where you have the option to filter on keyword, language and technology.</p>

<p>The second method is to highlight a keyword within your code file and filter on that:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/All-In-Code-Framework_12560/All-In-One-Code-2.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/All-In-Code-Framework_12560/All-In-One-Code-2_thumb.png" alt="All In One Code 2" /></a></p>

<p>There are currently 678 sample applications that span a very wide area. The people behind this strive to create each sample using C#, VB.Net and C++, as well as for Visual Studio 2008 and Visual Studio 2010, so you should always be able to find sample in the language that you require. If you can’t, there is also the option to request a particular <a href="http://1code.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Request%20Code%20Sample%20from%20Microsoft%20All-In-One%20Code%20Framework&amp;referringTitle=Documentation">code sample</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have specified the location that you want to store the downloaded sample applications:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/All-In-Code-Framework_12560/image.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/All-In-Code-Framework_12560/image_thumb.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>You have the option to either download the sample applications as and when you require them, or you can download them all at once. Also, if an update to an application is published to the CodePlex site, the application notifies you of this, and gives you the option to upgrade.</p>

<p>All in all, I think that this is going to be a useful resource, and I would encourage you to take a look. Part of becoming a better programmer involves reading other peoples code, and this application gives you access to lots of it.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/a-modification-to-my-use-of-extensionsync/" itemprop="url">A Modification to My Use of #ExtensionSync</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>In an earlier <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=189">blog post</a> I mentioned how I am now using a very clever Visual Studio 2010 extension called <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/dbaf0ac9-fb7b-4fb3-b34d-ea2269276d3c">ExtensionSync</a> (a complete list of all the Visual Studio 2010 extensions that I am currently using can be found <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=3">here</a>).</p>

<p>In that blog post I explained that I am using a mapped drive in order in “share” the ExtensionSync settings file between different developers in the team. Initially, this worked well, but there were a few problems with this, and this was actually noted by the author of the tool in a Twitter conversation.</p>

<p>Basically, when you make a change, i.e. you add another extension, it saves the changes to the shared settings file it will work great until another developer who perhaps already had Visual Studio 2010 open, closes his Visual Studio. When this happens, his current extensions will be persisted to the shared ExtensionSync settings file, removing the extension that you just added. Not good!</p>

<p>After giving it some thought, it occurred to me that this file was actually living in the wrong place. This file should really be treated as an <em>artefact</em> of the project, and as such, should live in our source control repository.</p>

<p>The way our source control is configured, we have a folder called SharedSource. In here we keep things like, code analysis dictionaries, shared strong key files, shared code snippets, etc, so this seemed like a perfect place to put the ExtensionSync settings file.</p>

<p>With that checked in, it was a quick change to the ExtensionSync settings to point it at the new settings file location and everything was set up.</p>

<p>The benefit of using this approach is that unless “checked out” the settings file is read only, so that even if it wanted to, ExtensionSync can’t make changes to the file (I was worried that this would cause ExtensionSync to complain, but so far I haven’t seen this).</p>

<p>It also has the benefit of applying some process to making changes to the extensions that are used. A developer now have to go through the process of checking out the settings file, installing the extension, and then checking back in. This formality means that a little more thought is given to the addition of an extension, and should prevent ad-hoc extensions appearing that are of little or no use.</p>

<p>It strikes me as well that there is a logical extension (no pun intended) to this approach. For instance, depending on the project that you are working on, you may want/need different extensions installed. If you are working on a SharePoint development project then you would want all the SharePoint helper extensions installed. However, there is absolutely no need have these installed if you are working on an ASP.Net MVC project. As a result, you might have an ExtensionSync settings file per project, which you could switch to as and when required. If this could be made to do this automatically based on the currently loaded project this would be great, but I don’t know what sort of overhead this would involve in terms of installing/uninstalling extensions. Perhaps a feature request though…</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>On Thursday 7th July, the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group was lucky enough to welcome <a href="http://www.kodefuguru.com/">Chris Eargle</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/kodefuguru">@KodefuGuru</a>), a Telerik Developer Evangelist from Columbia, South Carolina, to do a talk entitled “<a href="http://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Meetings/Secrets-of-a--Net-Ninja.aspx">Secrets of a .Net Ninja</a>”.</p>

<p>Due to the format of this presentation, primarily focused around code demonstrations, there was only an introductory set of slides, so I have not posted them here.</p>

<p>However, all of the code (and much, much more) that Chris talked through on the night is available at his CodePlex Project which you can find <a href="http://kodefu.codeplex.com/">here</a>. I am in the process of downloading the latest version as I type <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" />.</p>

<p>There was no messing around in this talk, we jumped straight into talking about:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Private Member Inheritance</p></li>
<li><p>Removing the use of Out Parameters</p></li>
<li><p>Extension Method Refactoring</p></li>
<li><p>Advanced use of LINQ, Lambdas and Anonymous Methods
There was a lot of content in this presentation, and there was certainly a lot of food for thought. The sample code helps in cementing how these techniques can be used in your day-to-day programming activities.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Unfortunately I wasn’t able to go, but some of the guys took Chris to the <a href="http://www.brewdog.com/">BrewDog</a> bar for a round of <a href="http://www.brewdog.com/sink_the_bismark">Sink The Bismarck</a> after the meeting, I hope he doesn’t miss his flight back home to the states today!</p>

<p>Big thanks to Chris for taking time to visit the <a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Home.aspx">Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group</a>.</p>

<p>Don’t forget about our next event which is happening on the Thursday 21st July 2011. <a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/">Paul Stack</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/stack72">@stack72</a>), a Continuous Integration enthusiast, is travelling up to present his talk entitled “<a href="http://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Meetings/Beginners-Guide-to-CI.aspx">Beginners Guide to CI</a>”. I have seen this talk once before (although I know he has added some parts to it since I last saw it so interested to see what he has lined up) and I would encourage anyone who is interested in getting started with CI, or even if you are already using it, to come along.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>As some of you may have noticed, I have switched from using the #ADNUG hash tag to using #ADNUGUK on Twitter. This is due to the fact that there was a clash with the <a href="http://www.adnug.org/">Austin Dot Net User Group</a>, as well as the <a href="http://www.adnug.com/">Adelaide Dot Net User Group</a>, so if you are ever mentioning the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group can I ask you to use #ADNUGUK.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/i-did-not-know-that-fiddler-could-do-this/" itemprop="url">I Did Not Know That #Fiddler Could Do This…</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>One of the most essential tools for working on web development is Fiddler:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/">http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/</a></p>

<p>For those who don’t know:</p>

<blockquote>  
> 
>    
> 
> Fiddler is a Web Debugging Proxy which logs all HTTP(S) traffic between your computer and the Internet. Fiddler allows you to inspect all HTTP(S) traffic, set breakpoints, and &#8220;fiddle&#8221; with incoming or outgoing data. Fiddler includes a powerful event-based scripting subsystem, and can be extended using any .NET language.
> 
>    
> 
> </blockquote>


<p>This tool has helped me out in a number of situations, and it is actually one of the first things that I <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=198">install on my machine</a> if I ever need to rebuild it.</p>

<p>The other day when using Fiddler I was blown away by a feature that I had not seen before. Namely, the ability to filter HTTP traffic coming from a single process. The concept is by no means a new one, but it is the way in which Fiddler does it that I thought was very clever.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Steps</em></strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p> Open your web browser ready for inspecting traffic</p></li>
<li><p> Open Fiddler</p></li>
<li><p> Find the “Process Filter” toolbar item in the main toolbar</p></li>
</ol>


<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/image.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/image_thumb.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<ol>
<li> Hover your mouse hover this and you will see the following tooltip which pretty much explains it all. Click your mouse on the “Process Filter” button and the text will change to say “pick target…” and the icon will change to be a cross hair.</li>
</ol>


<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/image1.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/image_thumb1.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<ol>
<li><p> With the left mouse button still held down, move the mouse to the window (process) that you want to filter the HTTP target from. In this case, it is the web browser that you opened in step 1, but it could equally be any other application that is communicating over HTTP.</p></li>
<li><p> The “Process Filter” button will change again to show the process id that it is filtering HTTP traffic from</p></li>
</ol>


<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/image2.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/image_thumb2.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<ol>
<li> Once you are finished, simply left click the “Process Filter” toolbar item again and the filter will be removed.</li>
</ol>


<p>In my case, if I open Fiddler on my non development machine I have HTTP traffic coming from Windows Live Mesh, Outlook, OneNote, BookMark synchronisation, etc. Trying to figure out what is going on with one “thing” can be difficult, this filtering ability makes it very easy, and as I mentioned I think the way in which you select the process to filter on is VERY clever.</p>

<p>The idea behind this event, which was first started in Dallas, Texas, is that a bunch of like minded developers get together and help out a group of charities and non-profit organisations with their technology requirements. My understanding is that this could range from creating a website from scratch to deploying a WordPress Blog that they require for their site.</p>

<p>At present, the event has fulfilled it’s quota for required volunteers (developers, designers and database administrators), but if you are interested, you can still <a href="http://www.givecamp.org.uk/volunteer">sign up</a> to be on a shortlist in case some people have to drop out.</p>

<p>I am delighted to say that I have made it onto the list and I am very much looking forward to taking part in the event, although, having never done anything like this before, I have to admit that I am a little bit nervous. What makes it worse is that I know that there are a lot of VERY talented developers taking part in the event. This is great for the charities, as they will get the benefit of the wealth of their combined experience, but from a personal stand point, it does make it a little intimidating <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Looking-forward-to_1194B/wlEmoticon-sadsmile.png" alt="Sad smile" />.</p>

<p>However, I am determined to make this most of this experience, as I firmly believe that I will get as much out of this, as hopefully the charities will get from me. It is a great chance to socialise with and learn from other developers, and be exposed to technologies and processes that I might otherwise not have seen.</p>

<p>For more information on the event, you can find the organisers on Twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/givecampuk">@GiveCampUK</a>) and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/GiveCampUK">FaceBook</a>.</p>
