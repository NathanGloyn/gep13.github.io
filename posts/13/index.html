	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Wow!</p>

<p>Following up on a very interesting <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=361">session this morning</a>, Dylan Beattie (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/dylanbeattie">@dylanbeattie</a>) provided a VERY interesting session called “<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/front-end-tips-for-back-end-devs">Front-End Tips for Back-End Devs</a>”</p>

<p>The session started out with a whistle stop tour of HTML 5 including a pop quiz about new things that are going out. Example pop quiz question:</p>

<blockquote>  
> 
> Which of these is NOT an HTML5 element?
> 
>    
> 
> <command> <iframe> <ruby> <shortcut> <progress> <time>
> 
> </blockquote>


<p>For the answer, take a look at the following:</p>

<p><a href="http://joshduck.com/periodic-table.html">http://joshduck.com/periodic-table.html</a></p>

<p>Which lists all the current HTML5 elements in the form of a periodic table.</p>

<p>The talk then took a <strong>VERY</strong> interesting turn and started to describe how you could apply the SOLID coding principles to your Web Sites’ CSS.</p>

<p><strong>“S” is for Single Responsibility</strong></p>

<p>Dylan described the concept of taking traditional CSS and turning it inside out. Rather than containing all the styles, for example font, colour, size etc, within a single, specific, CSS definition, instead create a CSS definition that does one thing, for instance, makes “stuff” red. That way, you can apply multiple selectors to this CSS definition to apply the colour red to an element.</p>

<p><strong>“O” is for Open-Closed Principle</strong></p>

<p>Dylan suggested three main rules to follow when applying this principle:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Don’t use !Important</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t use classes</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t use ID’s</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Although, he did concede that in some places, the latter two HAD to be broken.</p>

<p><strong>“L” is for Liskov Substitution</strong></p>

<p>Due to the fact that we (as Web Developers) are restricted in the base types that we can inherit from, there is not much that can be done here in applying this particular principle.</p>

<p><strong>“I” is for Interface Segregation</strong></p>

<p>The example that was provided was that this:</p>

<p><input class=”tall wide next button” /></p>

<p>is a lot easier to read and maintain than:</p>

<p><input class=”tallWideNextButton” /></p>

<p><strong>“D” is for Dependency Inversion</strong></p>

<p>Although he has tried, Dylan said that there is no direct application of this principle to CSS.</p>

<p>Now, after hearing all of the above, I have to admit that I was a little thrown. It literally goes against everything that I have learnt to date about applying CSS, and it took a while to digest it.</p>

<p>However, after giving it some thought, it does appear to make some sense. I guess it will really only be after I have used this technique in anger that I will be able to make a final decision on whether it makes sense to me.</p>

<p>The session wrapped up with Dylan demonstrating his WebGloss Nuget package. Here he showed how you could create the base styles, master pages, JavaScript etc for a site, package it up into a Nuget package, and then apply this to a blank ASP.Net MVC application. If required, you could then override things that were specific to the new application.</p>

<p>I have to say I really like this approach, and I will be keeping a look out for the final release of WebGloss once Dylan makes it available. HINT: If you could let me know when it is available I would be very grateful <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Day-1Afternoon-Session-prognet11-skillsm_FF94/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" /></p>

<p>In summary, a great session that I would highly recommend you watching back on the Skills Matter site.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>As per my earlier <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=358">blog post</a>, this morning I attended the “<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/patterns-and-practices-of-package-management">Solving the Packaging Puzzle</a>” featuring Ian Cooper (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/icooper">@ICooper</a>) and Sebastian Lambla (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/serialseb">@serialseb</a>).</p>

<p>This talk was split into two parts.</p>

<p>The first was the “theory” behind Packages and this was handled by Ian. This included a description of what a “package” is and how we can write our code in such a way as to lend itself for easier package creation.</p>

<p>The second part of the talk was handled by Sebastian, with a “real world” demo of creating a Web Site (using <a href="http://openrasta.org/">OpenRasta</a>) adding functionality, splitting this functionality into a separate project, packaging the re-usable code and including it in the original Web Site Project. All of this was handled using <a href="http://www.openwrap.org/">OpenWrap</a>.</p>

<p>A lot of the concepts that were described in the first part of the session were not news to me, but they are also not something that I have fully utilised. This is mainly because of my lack of full understanding of how everything pieces together. Ian went into great detail on things like:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Modular Decomposability</p></li>
<li><p>Modular Composability</p></li>
<li><p>Modular Continuity</p></li>
<li><p>Modular Protection</p></li>
<li><p>Direct Mapping</p></li>
<li><p>Few Interfaces</p></li>
<li><p>Small Interfaces</p></li>
<li><p>SOLID code principles
And how these can be used to ensure that the code base is constructed property.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>These are all topics that I have heard about, but never fully put into practice. If nothing else, this morning talk has highlighted that I “need” to read up on these topics. Ian has recommended two books:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0136291554/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0136291554">Object-Oriented Software Construction</a></p>

<p>and</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0131857258/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0131857258">Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C#</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=0131857258" alt="" /></p>

<p>Which I am going to have to add to my growing list of books that I have to read.</p>

<p>I got a lot out of the “refactoring” that Sebastian showed in his demonstration of how you can put all the theory into practice. And although the demonstration didn’t go as “smoothly” as I think Sebastian would have liked, for me, it really did hammer the point home.</p>

<p>I have never used OpenWrap, only Nuget. I would be interested to hear from anyone who has used both. Likes? Disklikes? etc.</p>

<p>All in all, a very good start to the Progressive .Net Tutorials, and I am looking forward to the remaining five sessions.</p>

		<p>And the announcements for the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group keep coming!</p>

<p>As I mentioned at our August Meeting I am happy to announce that <a href="http://twitter.com/markrendle">Mark Rendle</a> of <a href="http://www.dotnetsolutions.co.uk/">Dot Net Solutions Ltd</a> will be touring Scotland in October, stopping off in Aberdeen on Thursday 13th.</p>

<p>On the night, Mark will actually be doing two presentations:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Functional Alchemy: Tricks to keep your C# DRY*&rdquo;</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>&ldquo;How to manage your manager&rdquo;</p>

<p>You can find complete details of the talks, and register for it <a href="http://adnuguk-oct2011.eventbrite.com/">here</a>. To read about Marks own thoughts on the tour check out his blog post <a href="http://blog.markrendle.net/2011/08/30/on-tour/">here</a>.</p>

<p>As with the booking of the August and September Meetings, I am again using <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/">Eventbrite</a> to handle the registration of the October Meeting. In addition, I am going to use Eventbrite and <a href="http://www.mailchimp.com">MailChimp</a> to send out the invitations for the Event. In order to achieve this, I have moved the email addresses of all registered Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group members to a contact list within Eventbrite and MailChimp. If for some reason you would like your email address removed from this contact list, then please do not hesitate to get in contact with <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?page_id=38">me</a>.</p>

<p>I would greatly appreciate feedback on the decision to use Eventbrite in this manner. Do you like the idea? Do you think it is a terrible idea? Do you know of any other services that can be used? If you want to get in touch, feel free to either use the <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?page_id=38">contact form on this site</a>, or use the <a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Contact.aspx">contact form on the ADNUG site</a>.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/looking-forward-to-prognet11/" itemprop="url">Looking Forward to #prognet11</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>In a recent <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=313">blog post</a> I spoke about how we (as developers) all have to strive to become a “better developer”. From a personal stand point, I decided that I was going to try to attend the <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event/open-source-dot-net/progressive-dot-net-tutorials-2011">Progressive .Net Tutorials</a>, because in my opinion, the sessions were just too good to miss. After making this decision, I heard a rumour that Paul Stack (one of the speakers at the Tutorials) was in a position to <a href="http://www.paulstack.co.uk/blog/post/win-a-ticket-to-progressivenet-tutorials.aspx">give away two tickets to the event</a>.</p>

<p>On the off chance that I might win, I decided to drop an email to Paul, basically reciting what I had said in my blog post, and luckily for me, I won!!! <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/wlEmoticon-smile1.png" alt="Smile" /></p>

<p>I have now booked the hotel and flights for getting down there, and I have to say that I am really looking forward to the event. The only real problem now is deciding which sessions I want to attend.</p>

<p>First up “<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/defining-acceptance-criteria-in-gherkin">Gherking Acceptance Criteria</a>” or “<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/patterns-and-practices-of-package-management">Solving the Packaging Puzzle</a>”. Having given it a lot of thought, I am thinking that “Solving the Packaging Puzzle” is going to get my vote.</p>

<p>Next up “<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/coming-soon-2032">Automating Gherkin Acceptance Criteria with Specflow</a>” or “<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/front-end-tips-for-back-end-devs">Front-end Tips for Back-end Devs</a>”. Although I have heard a lot of good things about Specflow and it is on my list of things to look into, I think I am going to get more out of the “Front-end Tips for Back-end Devs” talk.</p>

<p>Moving onto the second day, we have the choice between “<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/load-testing-for-developers">Load Testing for Developers</a>” or “<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/test-driven-development-in-javascript">Test-driven Development in JavaScript</a>”. This is a tough for me, they both sound like great sessions. For now, I think I am leaning more towards the “Load Testing for Developers” session, but I might change my mind.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of the second day we have “<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/ci-to-cd">Continuous Integration to Continuous Delivery</a>” and “<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/advanced-websharper-tutorial-2359">Advanced WebSharper Tutorial</a>”. I think this one is an easier decision. I have a keen interest in Continuous Integration. At work we are already using a system of CI to automate the creation of a build package that we can deploy to a server, but I am interested to hear how we can take this to the next step and implement Continuous Delivery.</p>

<p>First up on the third day we have “<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/restful-web-service-development-in-dot-net">RESTful Web Service Development in .NET</a>” or “<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/async-methods-in-c-sharp-5-2389">Async Methods in C# 5</a>”. For me, I think the obvious choice has to be “Async Methods in C# 5”. I have read up on a few things that are shipping with C# 5, and to see some of these in action should be very interesting.</p>

<p>The final session in the Progressive .Net Tutorials is the choice between “<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/introduction-to-nancy-and-simple-data">Introduction to Nancy and Simple.Data</a>” and “<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/you-think-you-know-agile">You Think You Know Agile?</a>”. Again, this is a tough call for me. Part of me wants to learn something new, and Nancy and Simple.Data fit that bill perfectly, but it would also be good to concrete some of the stuff I “think” I know about Agile. I am still making a decision on this one, might come down to the day of the talk to actually make a decision.</p>

<p>I am not clear on how the sessions are being handled, and how potential “over-crowding” of a session is going to be handled, but hopefully I will be able to attend my first choice sessions. If not, I am sure I will still get a lot from the others.</p>

<p>Are you going to the Progressive .Net Tutorials? Have you decided which sessions you want to attend?</p>

		<p>I don’t know about you, but I am the kind of person that when I am thinking things through, I have to be “playing” with something.</p>

<p>If I am in front of the whiteboard, this normally ends with me doodling a picture, as I am the kind of person who thinks in pictures. If not in front of the whiteboard, I normally end up twirling a pen in my fingers. I find that this type of thing helps me concentrate, and focus on the problem at end. Although, I am aware that this can be slightly annoying to some of my colleagues, so there are times when make a conscious effort of trying to not do it.</p>

However, I found that these could be quite noisy, and distracting for other people in the office, so I have had to put these away.</p>

<p>Enter the new contender to the “mind focusing” realm….</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B004F86J76/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B004F86J76"><img src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.co.uk/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;Format=_SL110_&amp;ASIN=B004F86J76&amp;MarketPlace=GB&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822" alt="" /></a>A set of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B004F86J76/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B004F86J76">Magnetic Neodymium Cube Puzzle Balls</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B004F86J76" alt="" />. 216 separate magnetic balls that when constructed in the correct way form a perfect 6x6 cube.</p>

<p>I was introduced to these from a colleague at work, who also has a set. My Project Manager can’t understand why, but I find these very useful on a day to day basis, both in terms of focusing the mind, as well as a stress relief mechanism. The 216 balls can also be formed into a string, and as I am thinking about a problem I find myself working these around my hands. In addition, taking a couple minutes away from a problem to form the 6x6 cube helps to de-stress.</p>

<p>If like me to need to be “playing” with something to help you think, I would highly recommend these.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>As some of you may know, I have been using the <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=260">Office365</a> for some time now. I use it both for my personal email accounts, as well as the email accounts for the <a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/">Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group</a>. Personally, I think it is a great product, however, I have recently found out something rather <em><strong>annoying</strong></em> (that was the polite version of the word I wanted to use).</p>

<p>As advertised here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/plans/small-business/office-web-apps.aspx#fbid=0-IIc1QYd7Q">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/plans/small-business/office-web-apps.aspx#fbid=0-IIc1QYd7Q</a></p>

<p>one of the biggest selling points is the integration with mobile devices such as Windows Phone 7. Notice in the above link that I should be able to:</p>

<blockquote>  
> 
> Access and view files in high fidelity from your mobile device. 
> 
> </blockquote>


<p>Now, during the Office365 Beta, it was well understood that this functionality wasn’t available, however, when Office365 rolled out, it was going to be available to both the Professional and Small Business Plans for Office365.</p>

<p><em>NOTE: I am currently using the Small Business Plan</em></p>

<p>Now that the Beta is finished, and everything has settled down, I set about trying to get access to my SharePoint Team Site using the Office Hub on my Windows Phone 7, but I was disheartened to find out that it didn’t work.</p>

<p>Every time I try, I get the error message:</p>

<blockquote>  
> 
> SharePoint doesn’t support non-SharePoint servers and can’t open the requested content. You can try opening the content in your browser instead.
> 
> </blockquote>


<p>I have spoken to a couple people I know who also have a Windows Phone 7 handset and who use Office365, and they have told me that they can get this to work without any problems.</p>

<p>To start with, I thought that there must be something wrong with my setup, however, after doing some digging, it turns out that the problem is the plan that I am on! Namely, the P1 Small Business Plan.</p>

<p>At the minute, Windows Phone 7 Office Hub only supports access to SharePoint online via an HTTPS connection, and unfortunately, this is not offered in the P1 Small Business Plan. I can access the site through Internet Explorer Mobile, however, this doesn’t offer the high fidelity access to files that was promised above!!</p>

<p>A bit more digging turned up this:</p>

<p><a href="http://community.office365.com/en-us/w/sharepoint/527.aspx">http://community.office365.com/en-us/w/sharepoint/527.aspx</a></p>

<p>In my opinion, Microsoft have got the messaging very wrong here, and they need to do something to correct it, <em><strong>fast</strong></em>!!</p>

<p>I think both the Windows Phone 7 device and Office365 are great products, and I am willing to wait until Mango ships so that I can get them to work together, but I can understand how newcomers to either platform will be very disappointed to find out that what it promised isn’t actually possible yet!</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/a-cunning-plan-to-get-hd-content-on-upstairs-television/" itemprop="url">A Cunning Plan to Get HD Content on Upstairs Television</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>A few months back I <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=251">blogged</a> about how I was using a custom application on my Windows Phone 7 to control the wireless antenna in my ADSL router.  This was required because if the antenna was on while we were trying to watch Sky television upstairs via a wireless media sender, we would get interference on the screen upstairs.</p>

<p>I am happy to report that my custom Windows Phone 7 application can now be retired, as I now have a new, more complicated system <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" />.  Well, only slightly more complicated.  Bear with me while I try to explain it.</p>

<p>While we were getting the house decorated a couple months back I took the opportunity to run some Ethernet cable between a cupboard in our living room downstairs, upstairs to both the master bedroom, and the spare room (which is essentially the office).  I would have preferred that this Ethernet cable were CAT-6, however, the contractor that I hired only had CAT-5e (and it needed to be done that day as the decorator was then going to fill up the holes), more on this later.</p>

<p>I opted to have two individual Ethernet cables run between the cupboard and the master bedroom, and one between the cupboard and the office. (All of these cables are routed via the loft)</p>

<p>Now to explain, in the cupboard in the living room I have all the media devices that we use, this includes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Sky+ HD box</p></li>
<li><p>PS3</p></li>
<li><p>Wii</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The single cable is used to provide a wired connection between the PS3 and my <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=51">Synology Server</a> for streaming media down onto the downstairs TV.</p>

<p>The two cables running to the master bedroom were to be used to stream HD content from either the PS3 or the Sky+ HD box to the television upstairs.  The reason that I routed two cables was because originally I was going to use the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B002ECYEYA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B002ECYEYA">Neet - HDMI Extender</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B002ECYEYA" alt="" /> which required two dedicated cables to transmit the HD signal.</p>

<p>However, then I stumbled onto a similar device that claimed to be able to do the same job, but only use a single Ethernet cable!  This opened up the possibility of transmitting an HD signal from both the PS3 AND the Sky+ HD box, without the need to manually move cables around, or use some form of HD switching device.</p>

<p>I was intrigued!  My only concern was that I was using Cat-5e cable rather than Cat-6, and I was worried that I wouldn’t get as good a picture.  The decided that the only way to know for sure was to try it, and with that in mind I ordered the following kit.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001CYJQYO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B001CYJQYO">Climax Digital 2 Way HDMI Splitter</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001CYJQYO/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B001CYJQYO"><img src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.co.uk/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;Format=_SL110_&amp;ASIN=B001CYJQYO&amp;MarketPlace=GB&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822" alt="" /></a></p>

<p><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B001CYJQYO" alt="" /></p>

<p>I needed two of these.  This would be used to split the single signal from both the PS3 and the Sky+ HD box.  One would go directly into the TV downstairs, and the other would be routed via the HDMI Extender to the television upstairs.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B003YSW66Q/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B003YSW66Q">HDMI Extender over Single Cat5e</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B003YSW66Q" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B003YSW66Q/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B003YSW66Q"><img src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.co.uk/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;Format=_SL110_&amp;ASIN=B003YSW66Q&amp;MarketPlace=GB&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I needed two of these.  This would be used to take the second signal from the HDMI Splitter and do the magic of encoding the HD signal in such a way that it could be transmitted over Ethernet cable.  This device has two components, a sender and a receiver.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0017RW94A/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B0017RW94A">HDMI to HDMI Gold Plated Connectors</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B0017RW94A" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0017RW94A/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B0017RW94A"><img src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.co.uk/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;Format=_SL110_&amp;ASIN=B0017RW94A&amp;MarketPlace=GB&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I ended up buying a bunch of these.  You need one between the device and the splitter.  Two from the splitter, one to TV downstairs and one to the sender portion of the HDMI extender.  And one more between the receiver portion of the HDMI extender and TV upstairs.  Repeat for second device</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000OV0CEY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B000OV0CEY">10 Way 2 Metre surge Tower Extension Lead Socket</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B000OV0CEY" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000OV0CEY/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B000OV0CEY"><img src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.co.uk/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;Format=_SL110_&amp;ASIN=B000OV0CEY&amp;MarketPlace=GB&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Given the number of extra devices that I was putting into the cupboard I required some extra sockets in order to power them.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001RPWPQE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B001RPWPQE">Fisual Chunky Velcro Cable Ties - 10 Pack</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B001RPWPQE" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001RPWPQE/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B001RPWPQE"><img src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.co.uk/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;Format=_SL110_&amp;ASIN=B001RPWPQE&amp;MarketPlace=GB&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>In order to keep things tidy, well at least reasonable tidy, I used two packs of these to collect all the various cables together.</p>

<p>With all of the above in place and wired up, it was time for the moment of truth, was it all going to work….</p>

<p>The answer is yes!!</p>

<p>The picture and sound quality from both devices is exceptional.  I believe that you would be hard pushed to tell that either device was not directly plugged into the back of the upstairs TV.  In order to change between the Sky+ HD and the PS3 all that is required (on either TV) is to switch from one HDMI input to the other.</p>

<p>But, aha, the eagle eyed amongst you out there will still be wondering how I change the channel on the Sky+ HD box, or control the PS3 from upstairs.  Well, let me tell you…</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B003H4BVEK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B003H4BVEK">Remote Control Extender</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B003H4BVEK" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B003H4BVEK/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B003H4BVEK"><img src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.co.uk/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;Format=_SL110_&amp;ASIN=B003H4BVEK&amp;MarketPlace=GB&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822" alt="" /></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B003H4BVEK" alt="" /></p>

<p>This rather fetching device is used to take the Infra-Red signal from the Sky+ Remote Control and transmit it downstairs to the actual device.  Initially, we had some issues with alignment of this device in order to ensure that it worked, but once set up, it works perfectly.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B000OV0CEY" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000MWQTLU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B000MWQTLU">Sony Blu-Ray Disc Remote Control</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B000MWQTLU" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000MWQTLU/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B000MWQTLU"><img src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.co.uk/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;Format=_SL110_&amp;ASIN=B000MWQTLU&amp;MarketPlace=GB&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822" alt="" /></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B000MWQTLU" alt="" /></p>

<p>This uses Bluetooth to communicate with the PS3, so no need to repeat the signal, assuming that it is still in range.  I actually already owned one of these devices but I purchased a second one under the believe that I could use both at the same time.  However, this turns out to NOT be the case!  You can only have one Bluetooth Remote connected to the PS3 at once.  As a result, I use this device upstairs to control the PS3, and downstairs I use the standard PS3 controller.</p>

<p>And that, as they say, is that!</p>

<p>You could argue that the system is a “bit” complicated, and it could have been solved in other ways.  For instance, we could have set up Sky Multi-Room to allow us to watch Sky+ HD upstairs, and another PS3 could have been purchased and put upstairs.  However, both of these solutions would have meant additional hardware in the upstairs bedroom, and given the layout of the television, this would have been hard to achieve.  The above solution means that I can fully control all HD content from both the upstairs and downstairs TV.</p>

<p>Result!</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

		<p>In yesterdays <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=330">blog post</a> I mentioned how I was having some problems getting my shiny new 2 GB RAM for my ASUS 1015 PX working. I am happy to report that I now have it working!</p>

<p>Following a number of useful comments on the blog post, I set about trying a couple of things.</p>

<p>Firstly, I downloaded and installed <a href="http://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html">CPU-Z</a>, a freeware application that gathers information on some of the main devices on a system. This confirmed for sure that Windows 7 Starter was only seeing 1 GB of RAM.</p>

<p>The next plan of attack was to go into BIOS to make sure that there wasn’t something in there that had to be changed. But then came the inevitable question, which button gets you into BIOS? Is it F2? Is it Del? Is it Insert? After about 5 minutes of various different keyboard mashing and reboots, I was still unable to get into BIOS. A quick Google confirmed that there was no secret ASUS keyboard shortcut to get into BIOS, but I still couldn’t get into.</p>

<p>In a hopeless attempt, I decided to turn off the “Fast Boot” option (the option that allows me to choose between booting into Windows as normal or a Linux Distro). When I did this and rebooted the machine, the standard screen that says hit F2 to go into BIOS returned, hurrah!!</p>

<p>Once in there I still couldn’t see any options to change anything to do with Memory <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/wlEmoticon-sadsmile1.png" alt="Sad smile" /></p>

<p>Just as I was away to come out and try something else, I noticed on the main screen that the reported amount of RAM on the System was 2 GB! Weird!</p>

<p>So I decided to head back into Windows, on the off chance that simply going into BIOS (or turning the “Fast Boot” option off) had resulted in the full 2 GB of RAM was now being reported, and guess what…</p>

<p>It is!!!</p>

<p>Now, part of me is curious as to what is going on here, so if anyone knows, I would be very interested to know, another part of me is just glad that it is working, and that I don’t have to go through the hassle of trying to return the RAM.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Following a comment on a recent <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=319">blog post</a>, I went on over to the Crucial website and confirmed that my NetBook was capable of handling 2 GB of RAM, and I was happy to find out that it could. I was even more happy to find out that it was only going to cost me £9.99, plus £2 for shipping bargain.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/58-2.jpg"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/58-2_thumb.jpg" alt="58 (2)" /></a></p>

<p>A couple days later, and I was the proud owner of a brand new stick of 2 GB of RAM.</p>

<p>The memory compartment for the ASUS 1015PX is located on the base of the NetBook, pictured on the left, and there is one simple screw keeping the compartment secure.</p>

<p>With this removed, I was able to expose the current 1GB of RAM that is installed on the NetBook, pictured below.<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/5a-2.jpg"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/5a-2_thumb.jpg" alt="5a (2)" /></a></p>

<p>To remove the currently installed RAM, it is a simple process of pushing the flexible piece of metal at each side of stick of RAM, and the RAM will pop up slightly out of secure holding.</p>

<p>With that done, you can simply lift the stick of RAM out of it holder.</p>

<p>Putting the new stick of RAM in is just as simple. Place the RAM into the opening of the secure holder, and gently push the top of the stick until the flexible piece of metal at each side snaps in to place.</p>

<p>The result of my efforts are pictured below.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/5b-2.jpg"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/5b-2_thumb.jpg" alt="5b (2)" /></a></p>

<p>With the new stick of RAM securely seated in the holder, the only thing left to do is to tighten the screw again, and the jobs done, all you have to do is boot back into Windows, and start enjoying your computers new found power!</p>

<p>However….</p>

<p>There would now appear to be a problem <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/wlEmoticon-sadsmile.png" alt="Sad smile" /></p>

<p>When I started up my NetBook, and booted back into Windows, I was greeted with the following when I went into the system properties:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/image.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/image_thumb.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>For some reason, the new stick of RAM has not been recognised, but the NetBook is functioning correctly?!?</p>

<p>Upon checking <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/system-requirements">here</a> I am now concerned that I need a 64 bit operating system in order to take advantage of the 2 GB of RAM. Can anyone confirm that this is the case?</p>
