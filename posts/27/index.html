	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/stuart-macbride-flesh-house/" itemprop="url">Stuart MacBride: Flesh House</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>While me and Lynn were at the Chinook Mall, I picked up a couple new books:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Flesh-House-Stuart-MacBride/dp/0007244541/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1220410781&amp;amp;sr=8-1">Stuart MacBride&rsquo;s Flesh House (fourth in the series)</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Gum-Thief-Douglas-Coupland/dp/0747591881/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1220410890&amp;amp;sr=1-1">Douglas Coupland&rsquo;s The Gum Thief</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>Just finished reading Flesh House, and again, I really enjoyed it! Gory as ever, but lot&rsquo;s of great dialogue, and the story flowed very well. I don&rsquo;t know if he is working on a new book, but if he is, I will definitely pick it up. If you are interested, you can find out more about the author <a href="http://www.stuartmacbride.com/en/">here</a>. Just read on that site that there is a new book out, but it isn&rsquo;t starring Logan McRae, or Aberdeen, but I will probably still get it.</p>

<p>Not sure when I will get round to reading The Gum Thief, but I will get round to it at some point.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I finally got round to finishing reading the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Broken-Skin-Stuart-MacBride/dp/0007193173/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1220410166&amp;amp;sr=8-2">third in the series of books from Stuart MacBride</a>. I have had this book for ages, and I have started reading it a couple of times, but I just haven&rsquo;t been able to finish it.</p>

<p>Started reading it this morning, and once I had started, I couldn&rsquo;t put it down, so needless to say it was very good!!</p>

<p>I have been a big fan of these books since I picked up the first one on my way to Singapore. This isn&rsquo;t simply because the stories are based in Aberdeen, but because they are just VERY well written, and this one is no exception.</p>

<p>Would recommend it to anyone!! If you need any help with translating the Doric, let me know.</p>

		<p>Ok, first of all, no, I am not making that name up!! This place actually <a href="http://www.golf-courses.ca/detail-golf-course-7228.html">exists</a>.</p>

<p>I was invited to go along with some of the guys from the office to play the back nine at this golf course this morning. Had to get up at 4:45am, but it was well worth it!! The back nine of this course looks out over the city of Calgary, and when the sun was rising it was really nice to look out over the city!!</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t bring any of my own golf stuff with me to Calgary so I had to borrow a set of clubs, but I didn&rsquo;t put up to bad a showing!! Only one of a hand full of times that I have played golf this year, but it was good to get out on the course.</p>

<p>The back nine is quite short, only one par 5, and I think it was 4 par 3&rsquo;s. Hopefully going to play a few more times while I am here before the course closes for Winter, and maybe get a chance to play the full 18 holes.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Again, let me state, this I am a huge fan of this franchise. Absolutely loved the first two films and even enjoyed the spin off The Scorpion King. However, the new <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443701/">Mummy</a> film was a little bit of a let down.</p>

<p>Firstly, why oh why, was Rachel Weisz not in this movie?!?!? No offence to Maria Bello, but the film just wasn&rsquo;t the same without Rachel. The humour that normally goes along with the Mummy series also seemed to be a little lacking, with one too many references to the previous films.</p>

<p>On the plus side, visual effects were very good, and the fight scenes were also good! But overall, not great. I will probably still buy it on DVD though to complete the set, and I will also probably go and see the new Scorpion King movie that is coming out.</p>

		<p>Ok, let me just state that I have been a great man of the X Files, ever since it came out, and I have watched every episode, watched the film, and read the books, so needless to say, I was really looking forward to this new <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443701/">film</a>.</p>

<p>Having watched the trailer for the movie, and seen Billy Connolly on his knees with what looks like the “Black Oil” coming out his eyes, I thought the long running story line of alien gunk was going to be continued in this movie&hellip;.</p>

<p>&hellip;how wrong could I be. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, the movie was good, but it wasn&rsquo;t like the X Files of old, and if anything, it was like an extended episode, not a film.</p>

<p>Also, it just wasn’t right to see Mulder and Scully getting it on <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/wlEmoticon-smile2.png" alt="Smile" /></p>

		<p>Today me and Lynn headed up to Edmonton to check out the West Edmonton Mall. The mall itself was absolutely massive!! I haven&rsquo;t been to anything like it in the UK, it quite simply has everything!! Shops (probably 2-3 of each kind), Ice Skating, Swimming Pool, Roller-Coasters, Food Stalls, Sea Lion shows, everything. You can check out some pictures of the trip below:</p>

<p>[nggallery id=23]</p>

<p>However, what was the best thing about the trip?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s right, the hire car!!! No idea how or why, but the second hire car that we got was a Mustang!! It was an absolutely amazing car!! You can see some pictures of it below:</p>

<p>HILARIOUS!!!!</p>

<p>Me and Lynn went to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0838283/">Step Brothers</a> today, and I think I can say that we both really enjoyed it!! It was really funny, Will Ferrell and John Reilly did a great job of playing the characters. The beating up of the school yard bullies at the end of the film was maybe a little over the top, but all in all, a great film!!!</p>

		<p>After meeting up with the people from my work at Atlas for lunch, me and Lynn headed to the Calgary Tower. I had wanted to take Lynn for a meal at the top in the revolving restaurant, however, it was going through some renovation while she was here. You can check out the pictures from the top of the tower below:</p>

<p>[nggallery id=21]</p>

<p>Please don&rsquo;t ask about the picture of and the beaver, I honestly have got no idea what I was thinking!!</p>

<p>After the Calgary Tower we headed to the Stampede Casino. Had a really good time playing on the Black Jack table and the slot machines. The cocktails in there are really good!! Didn&rsquo;t have quite as much luck as I did the last time I was there, but still had a good time!!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Me and Lynn took a few days to travel up to Banff to do some of the touristy things.</p>

<p>With the car hired, we travelled up to Banff, but we stopped on the way to visit Canmore and have some lunch. You can see some photos of that below:</p>

<p>[nggallery id=15]</p>

<p>Then it was back on the road to our final destination the Rimrock Hotel (took a slight detour with the GPS, but got there). The hotel was amazing, felt a fit underdressed with my shorts and t-shirts, but what the eh!! Had to get our room changed, since I had paid for an unobstructed view, and there was a tree right in front of our window. You can see some of the photos of the hotel below:</p>

<p>[nggallery id=20]</p>

<p>While we were waiting for our room to get sorted out, we went up on the Gondola ride to the top of Sulphur Mountain. The views from the top were amazing!!!  See for yourself:</p>

<p>[nggallery id=19]</p>

<p>The next day, we got back in the car and went in past Lake Louise:</p>

<p>[nggallery id=17]</p>

<p>on the way to our final destination which was a helicopter ride over the Rockie Mountains:</p>

<p>[nggallery id=18]</p>

<p>Lake Louise was really nice, the colour of the water was just magnificent, has to be seen to be believed. We didn&rsquo;t really have a lot of time at Lake Louise, since we had to get up the road for the chopper ride, you could have easily spent the whole day at Lake Louise. So it was back in the car, and onto the chopper!! We decided that we wanted to do the Nature Hike as well as the chopper ride, so after 20 minutes in the chopper (I got the front seat) the pilot landed, and we took a quick walk to a nearby waterfall. Lynn didn&rsquo;t really want to investigate, but I couldn&rsquo;t stop myself walking up to the edge and peering over.</p>

<p>The next day, we wandered round the shops in Banff and bought some presents for everyone:</p>

<p>We had a great time, and you can see the photos from here:</p>

<p>[nggallery id=14]</p>

<p>It is a long story, but there is also a 20 minute video of me being dressed up as a tiger, and basically being humiliated, still haven&rsquo;t found a way of showing this on my site, but I think it will be making its way onto Lynn&rsquo;s Bebo page at some point, so keep your eyes open for it, it is quite funny!</p>

<p>We also got stuck in a hail storm while on our way back from the zoo, but not to worry, we bought some very sexy white ponchos to protect us!! <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/wlEmoticon-smile1.png" alt="Smile" /></p>
