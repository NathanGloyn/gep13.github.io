		<h1>A busy second day at DevWeek&hellip;</h1>

<p>What follows is a brief summary of the sessions that I attended at the 2nd overall day of DevWeek 2013 (the first day of actual sessions).  Review of the other days of DevWeek can be seen here:</p>

</ul>


<p>In this the 16th year of DevWeek, Dave Wheeler was meant to be doing the Keynote presentation, however, due to suffering a back injury, Kevlin Henney and Steve Plank, stepped in to do two sessions for the Keynote.</p>

<h1>First Morning Session</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/kevlinhenney">Kevlin Henney</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/plankytronixx">Steve Plank</a></p>

<p><strong>Topic: </strong>&ldquo;A Question of Craftsmanship&rdquo; and &ldquo;Advances in Cloud Computing Platform&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>Personally, I thought that these were two very good sessions.  Kevlin&rsquo;s gave a very thought-provoking discussion about thinking about code as art, and how we should be ensuring that we strive to create the best code possible.  And Steve gave a great demo of how complicated systems can be configured and deployed in Windows Azure.  I also really liked Steve&rsquo;s slides, which really have to be seen to be understood.  They were essentially drawings, which were created as he was speaking.</p>

<p>While leaving the room, I heard some mumblings from some other delegates that the second talk was a sales pitch, but I really don&rsquo;t think that this was how it was intended.  I guess you can&rsquo;t please everyone!</p>

<p><strong>Takeaways</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Is code art?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Well it can be - <a href="http://mamememo.blogspot.co.uk/2010/09/qlobe.html">Qlobe from Yusuke Endoh</a></p></li>

<h1>Second Morning Session</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Kevin Jones (you can find him on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinrjones">here</a> and on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/kevinrjones">here</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Topic: </strong>Building interactive clients with knockout.js</p>

<blockquote>Client side development in the browser is becoming more and more important. Clients expect highly interactive applications that respond quickly to changes. To manage this developers have to cope with the demands of JavaScript. While jQuery is a fantastic tool, sometimes it feels too low-level and maybe needs something layered on top. One such layering is knockout.js. This provides an MVVM programming model for the browser. This talk looks briefly at the basis for MVVM and then into the details of knockout.js. We will cover the data-binding that is at the heart of this toolkit looking for example at how knockout does data updates and computed values. We will also see how knockout can work with your server-side coding.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>I went to Kevin&rsquo;s full day session on Unit Testing at last years DevWeek so I knew that he is a great speaker, and I am happy to say that again, I was not disappointed.  Through a number of examples, each building on top of each other, we were provided with a very good introduction to what knockout.js is, and how it can be used.</p>

<p>At one point, Kevin seemed to go off on a bit of tangent when trying to describe a particular situation, when his demo didn&rsquo;t do what he expected.  He was able to turn this around very well though, and the end result was a discussion about using &ldquo;debugger&rdquo; on the click event of any bound element to step into the JavaScript debugger of the browser you are using to enable you to figure out exactly what is going on, and what contexts are being used by knockout.js.  This was the number one takeaway from this session.  This technique is described in this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9261296/any-good-techniques-to-debug-template-binding-faults-for-knockout-js">StackOverflow question</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Takeaways</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Two way bindings, by default, are applied with you tab off an element, i.e. lostFocus, but this can be changed</p></li>
<li><p>i.e. you can use valueUpdate binding with a value of say afterKeyDown</p></li>
<li><p>Knockout.js intellisense is coming in Visual Studio 2012 Update 2</p></li>
<li><p>When using a foreach binding, no HTML will be rendered if the collection is empty</p></li>
<li><p>There is a mapping plugin for knockout.js with helps with mapping to and from JSON when communicating with the server</p></li>
<li><p>It is possible to create your own extensions for knockout.js</p></li>
<li><p>There is a validation extension for knockout.js</p></li>
<li><p>I believe that the code used in this session will be put <a href="https://github.com/kevinrjones/DevWeek2013">here</a> in Kevin&rsquo;s github repo</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Quotes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>&ldquo;jQuery is non trivial to use, but I love it like a brother&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;If your heart gives out, I am not responsible&rdquo; - when discussing the amazing HTML interface that he was creating</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>First Afternoon Session</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Scott Allen (you can find his blog <a href="http://odetocode.com/blogs/all">here</a>, and twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/OdeToCode">here</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Topic: </strong>The new world of HTML5 and CSS3</p>

<blockquote>WebSockets, Webworkers, animations, transitions, and SVG. These are just a few of the new capabilities we can use to build applications with modern browsers.
In this session we’ll give overviews and demonstrations of these new features and see how to build applications with the latest standards.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>This was a very good talk.  Scott&rsquo;s laid back approach to presenting makes it very easy to get absorbed in what he is saying, and you don&rsquo;t realise where the time goes!  The 90 minutes were up very quickly!</p>

<p>The only thing that I would say is there was a lot of jumping between the PowerPoint version of his slides, and an HTML version of his slides.  I think he could have quite easily done the entire presentation from the HTML version, rather than just showing the demos from the HTML version.  Not sure why he took the decision to do it this way.</p>

<p><strong>Takeaways</strong></p>

<p>Throughout this talk, there were a number of sites that were shown that really help you get started with HTML5 and CSS3, so some of the below are simply links to these sites.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://caniuse.com/">http://caniuse.com/</a> - very cool site which shows which elements are supported in which browsers</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://html5test.com/">http://html5test.com/</a> - provides a score for browsers in terms of how well they implement HTML5.  For instance, at the time of writing, Chrome scores 463.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">http://html5boilerplate.com/</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.css3.info/preview/">http://www.css3.info/preview/</a> - site showing how CSS3 can be used</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2009/redesigning-with-html-5-wai-aria/">Interesting post about HTML5</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts">Google Fonts</a> - a site to provide the necessary CSS to enable certain fonts on your site</p></li>
<li><p>Declare the language encoding that your site uses as early as possible in the page</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://thehtml5quiz.com/">http://thehtml5quiz.com/</a> - how many html elements can you name in 5 minutes?</p></li>
<li><p>HTML 5 video tag doesn&rsquo;t support DRM</p></li>
<li><p>For debugging WebSockets, you can&rsquo;t use fiddler right now, you would need to use something like WireShark</p></li>
<li><p>The code for the session can be found <a href="https://t.co/3vineLMtJN">here</a></p></li>
</ul>


<h1>Second Afternoon Session</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Andrew Clymer (you can find his blog <a href="http://andyclymer.blogspot.co.uk/">here</a>, and twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewclymer">here</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Topic: </strong>Taking advantage of C# 5 async/await</p>

<blockquote>.NET 4 introduced the new ‘task’ abstraction, and C# 5 will take advantage of integrating this into the language via the async and await keywords. Furthermore, the new task abstraction promotes a new way of architecting asynchronous behaviour; in this talk we will explore how to take advantage of these new keywords and other new types and features being exposed in the next version of .NET to deliver far simpler asynchronous Windows UI&#8217;s.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>I was very much looking forward to this talk.  I have seen the usage of async/await before, and I have played with it in a Windows Phone application that I was creating, but I was interested to find out more about it.  There was no faulting the speakers knowledge on the subject, it was excellent, however, there were a couple of things about the talk that were slightly off-putting for me.</p>

<p>Firstly, the use of a second person, Richard Blewett, on stage to drive the transition of the slides, and also to generate the code.  For me, this didn&rsquo;t really work.  Rich was using Andrew&rsquo;s laptop that had a different configuration than he was used to which meant that there were problems when building and running code.</p>

<p>Secondly, when requesting that a slide be moved to the next one, there was a click of the fingers, which again for me, was quite off-putting.</p>

<p><strong>Takeaways</strong></p>

<p>There were actually some really interesting takeaways from this session.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I really liked how the history of asynchronous methods have changed through the different version of the .Net Framework</p></li>
<li><p>Anything that takes longer than 15ms to complete shouldn&rsquo;t be done on the UI thread</p></li>
<li><p>You can only use the new async key word on a method that returns a void, or a Task<T></p></li>
<li><p>Using async/await makes the compiler do the work of creating the continuations that you would have otherwise have to create yourself</p></li>
<li><p>There are techniques to use CancellationTokenSource and IProgress to provide updates back to the UI and to control execution of the Task</p></li>
<li><p>Whenever you are using a thread, whether in UI code, or on the server, you should look to implementing async/await to release threads when not being used.</p></li>
<li><p>I am expecting that the code for the presentation will be available <a href="http://rocksolidknowledge.com/Conferences.mvc/">here</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Quotes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>&ldquo;If an application doesn&rsquo;t respond, hit it harder, just like the kids, they respond to that&rdquo; - said jokingly when discussing the lack of response from the UI when blocked by executing code</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;She can crack an iPhone screen with her finger&rdquo; - again, when discussing the frustration felt by users when waiting on a non-responsive UI</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>Overall Thoughts</h1>

<p>As always, a very well executed day at DevWeek.  Everything seemed to run very smoothly.  The venue is amazing (even though it is a bit of a hike from the exhibition area to some of the rooms for talks), and the food for lunch and breaks is excellent.  Looking forward to tomorrow.  I took a few pictures on my phone, which you can see below:</p>

		<h1>Day 1 of DevWeek - SharePoint</h1>

<p>Today was the first day of <a href="http://www.devweek.com/">DevWeek 2013</a>, and once again, I am happy to say that it was a great day.  As some of you will be aware, I attended <a href="http://gep13.me/VhBYfB">DevWeek last year</a>, and I got a lot out of it.  When I got the opportunity to attend again, I jumped at it.  In the same way as I did last year, I intend to write a blog post about each day, with thoughts, takeaways, and various links to interesting things that come up during the days.  Luckily, in the same way as last year, I will be attending the entire week of DevWeek.</p>

<p>Review of the other days of DevWeek can be seen here:</p>

<h1>Pre-Conference Workshop at DevWeek</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Sahil Malik (you can find his blog <a href="http://blah.winsmarts.com/">here</a>, and twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/sahilmalik">here</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Topic:</strong> SharePoint 2013 workshop for developers</p>

<blockquote>Join us for a full day of SharePoint 2013 goodness. SharePoint 2013 has some remarkable improvements as compared to SharePoint 2010.
This day covers what you need to know about SharePoint 2013 as a SharePoint 2010 or 2007 developer. It also covers what you need to know as an ASP.NET developer to get a quick on-ramp to SharePoint 2013.
Overall we’ll aim to provide a comprehensive overview of what’s new in SharePoint 2013 in various areas, including apps, client-side technologies, security, BCS, workflows, WCM and internet facing sites, mobile development, search, and Business Intelligence.</blockquote>


<h1>Thoughts</h1>

<p>Due to the fact that we use SharePoint 2010 in-house, I was very interested to see what new functionality, abilities, modifications, etc, were coming with SharePoint 2013.  This is not an area that I have spent a lot of time looking into (there are no immediate plans to upgrade), but I was still very interested to hear what Sahil had to say.  I am very happy to say that I was not disappointed.</p>

<p>Sahil took us on a very fast paced, but interesting trip through:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What there was in 2010 and earlier</p></li>
<li><p>What was good</p></li>
<li><p>What was bad</p></li>
<li><p>What is new in 2013</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The session was incredibly fast based, but this was due mainly to the sheer amount of content that Sahil had.  Although there was a lot to take in, Sahil did a great job of ensuring that everyone was following along, and also stopped to take questions from the audience when required.</p>

<p>All in all, it was a great session, that has left a lot to think about.  There are a number of key features in SharePoint 2013 that I could see being very useful in our current development efforts.</p>

<h1>Takeaways</h1>

<p>There were lots of interesting topics discussed in this whirlwind discussion on everything regarding SharePoint 2013, but some of the main takeaways were:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Claims Based Authentication is the default in SharePoint 2013.  You can enable the &ldquo;old style&rdquo; authentication, but this will only affect the SharePoint Portal.  Behind the scenes, everything else will still be Claims Based, so it will need to be embraced.</p></li>
<li><p>SharePoint 2013 now using .Net Framework 4.5.  Hallelujah!!</p></li>
<li><p>All workflows authored in SharePoint are now housed within the Workflow Management Site&#8221;, which can be farmed off onto its own server.</p></li>
<li><p>Some &ldquo;stsadm&rdquo; commands that worked in SharePoint 2010, may no longer work in 2013.  The guidance is to use the SharePoint PowerShell Interface instead.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/powershell/archive/2012/06/27/windows-powershell-web-access-basic-installation-guide.aspx">PowerShell Web Access</a> - Very cool!</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fp161259.aspx">Test-SPSite</a> and <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fp161269.aspx">Repair-SPSite</a> - A great idea!  Especially since the tests that you can run are extensible!</p></li>
<li><p>In the new SharePoint model, both Application Pages and Site Pages run under Full Trust, regardless of CAS policies.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/jj220038.aspx">NAPA Office 365 Development Tools</a> - You can use a SharePoint 2013 App (authored by Microsoft) to create other SharePoint 2013 Apps</p></li>
<li><p>The Client Side Object Model and ReST API for SharePoint 2013 has been completely overhauled.  Now much nicer to work with!</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>Quotes</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>&ldquo;SharePoint teaches you a lot of patience!&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;Working on it&hellip;&rdquo; - this the new &ldquo;loading&rdquo; message that comes up whenever SharePoint is busy</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>Book Recommendations</h1>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<h1>It&rsquo;s a snap!</h1>

<p>If you have decided to <a href="http://gep13.me/VAeRiX">install your own instance of TeamCity</a>, then it is your responsibility to ensure that it is kept up to date.  <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/">JetBrains</a> have a fairly aggressive <a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TW/Previous+Releases+Downloads">release cadence</a>, with updates coming out every couple of months.  This is great, as you get a host of new features and bug fixes on a regular basis.</p>

<p>When performing an upgrade, the most important thing to do is to back up the database and configuration settings.  Luckily, this is a built-in process within the administration section of TeamCity.</p>

<p>This blog post steps through the full upgrade process.</p>

<h1>Installation Steps</h1>

<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>The following installation steps and screenshots were taken from a virtual machine   with Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1, running in Hyper-V on a Windows 8 Host Machine.</p>

<p>These instructions are specific to version 7.1.3 of TeamCity, however, later versions will likely follow very similar steps.  In addition, these installation instructions will install both the TeamCity Server and Build Agent onto the same machine.  Ideally, you would want to have a separate Build Agent Machine.</p>

<p>You can see screenshots of each of these steps in the galley at the bottom of this blog post.</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Assumption is that you already have <a href="http://gep13.me/VAeRiX">TeamCity</a> installed (otherwise, why would you be looking to upgrade it :-)</p></li>
<li><p> Assumption is that you have already <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/download/index.html">downloaded the new version of TeamCity</a>, in this case 7.1.4.</p></li>
<li><p> Log into TeamCity using an account that has Administrator privileges</p></li>
<li><p> Click on the Backup link near the bottom left hand corner</p></li>
<li><p> When the Run Backup Tab opens, click on &ldquo;Start Backup&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p> The backup should complete successfully</p></li>
<li><p> Double Click the installation *.exe which was downloaded in Step 2 above</p></li>
<li><p> At the first step in the installation wizard simply click Next</p></li>
<li><p> Read the License Agreement and assuming you are happy with it, click “I Agree”</p></li>
<li><p>. In the “Choose Install Location” window, assuming you are happy with the default installation folder, simply click Next, otherwise change it first</p></li>
<li><p>. In order to install the latest version of TeamCity, you have to first uninstall the current version.  Click &ldquo;Next&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>. On this screen simply click Next once the current installation has been located</p></li>
<li><p>. Typically, since you are doing an upgrade, you want to keep both the build configuration and working directory, but the log files can be removed.  Click Uninstall</p></li>
<li><p>. The un-installation will continue</p></li>
<li><p>. After a short period, the un-installation will complete</p></li>
<li><p>. In the “Choose Components” window choose the components that you want to install.  As already mentioned, we will be installing both the Server and Build Agent on one server.  Click Next</p></li>
<li><p>. In the “Specify server configuration directory” window assuming you are happy with the default location click Next, otherwise change it first</p></li>
<li><p>. The main portion of the installation will start now</p></li>
<li><p>. The “Configure Build Agent Properties” window will then open, giving you the opportunity to add/edit build agent properties.  For now, you can leave this as the default.  If needed, this can be changed later.  Click Save.</p></li>
<li><p>. Simply click OK on the “TeamCity Build Agent Properties” pop-up</p></li>
<li><p>. In the “Select Service Account for Server” window decide what user account you want to run the TeamCity Server, I chose to use the SYSTEM account.  Click Next</p></li>
<li><p>. In the “Select Service Account for Agent” window decide what user account you want to run the TeamCity Build Agent, I chose to use the SYSTEM account.  Click Next</p></li>
<li><p>. In the “Services” window, choose to start both the Server and Build Agent Services, and click Next</p></li>
<li><p>. In the final screen, ensure that the option to open TeamCity Website after exit is checked and click Finish.</p></li>
<li><p>. A web page will open saying “TeamCity is starting”</p></li>
<li><p>. The login screen will then be presented</p></li>
<li><p>. On logging in, you will see the latest version number displayed</p></li>
</ol>

		<h1>What is TeamCity NuGet Server?</h1>

<p>Within TeamCity, it is possible to integrate the NuGet Package Manager, which then allows you to:</p>

<p>If you want to find out more information about the TeamCity NuGet Server, you can find it <a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD7/NuGet">here</a></p>

<p>The following blog post walks through the steps to set up the TeamCity Nuget Server.</p>

<li><p> Log into your TeamCity instance</p></li>
<li><p> Click on the Administration link at the top right hand corner</p></li>
<li><p> Click on NuGet Settings down the left hand side</p></li>
<li><p> By default, the NuGet Server will be disabled, so simply click on Enable to start it up</p></li>
<li><p> By default, public access to the NuGet Server is not enabled, as the Guest User access will not be set up.  However, this can be done within Global Settings.  Assuming that you are wanting to easily gain access to the Feed that TeamCity provides, enabling this public access is recommended.  This is what we will do in the next few steps.</p></li>
<li><p> Click on Global Settings</p></li>
<li><p> Make sure that the &ldquo;Allow to login as a guest user&rdquo; checkbox is checked</p></li>
<li><p> Go back to NuGet Settings, and you should now see that the Public Feed URL is enabled, and a URL to the feed to provided</p></li>
<li><p>. Click on the &ldquo;NuGet Commandline&rdquo; tab.  In here you can actually have multiple versions of the NuGet.exe installed, ready for use within different Build Configurations.  Click on &ldquo;Add NuGet&rdquo;.</p></li>
<li><p>. Select the version that you want to install, and click Add.</p></li>
<li><p>. And that&rsquo;s that!</p></li>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<h1>How I finally got the Wireless Button (F2) on my Dell Studio 1558 working&hellip;</h1>

<p>After a very annoying couple of days with no wireless connection on my laptop, I was finally able to get it working.  Hopefully this will help anyone else who falls into the same problem.</p>

<h1>The Problem</h1>

<p>After doing a fresh install of Windows 8 on my Dell Studio 1558, I thought that everything was working perfectly.  Since the original install, I had no issues whatsoever.  However, the other day, I accidentally pressed the F2 key (this is the hardware button which will enable/disable the wireless radio).  I wasn&rsquo;t too concerned when this happened, as I thought that I could just press it again, and it would re-enable the radio, but&hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip;this didn&rsquo;t happen!  I was stuck with no wireless connection.</p>

<p>I tried everything that I could think of to fix the problem, and I couldn&rsquo;t get anything to work.  Everything seemed to be correct, but I still couldn&rsquo;t get a wireless connection.  What I was left with was this:</p>

<p>[gallery ids=&ldquo;1889,1890,1891&rdquo;]</p>

<h1></h1>

<h1>The Solution</h1>

<p>After googling everything that I could think of, I eventually, out of sheer desperation, decided to try using the &ldquo;Diagnose&rdquo; wizard, that you can find when right clicking on the network connection in control panel:</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_1888&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;359&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/problem-with-wireless-button-f2-on-dell-studio-1558-and-windows-8/diagnose_context_menu/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Diagnose_Context_Menu.png" alt="Diagnose Context Menu" /></a> Diagnose Context Menu[/caption]</p>

<p>This started a wizard which correctly identified that the Wireless Radio was indeed disabled  and to my surprise, provided an option to re-enable it.  I am happy to report that I now have a functioning wireless connection.  In addition, <a href="http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/laptop/w/laptop/4232.studio-1558-windows-8-64-bit.aspx">one of the sites</a> that I did stumble across, contained a complete list of Windows 8 compatible drivers for the Dell Studio 1558.  It would seem that Dell are not creating/maintaining Windows 8 compatible drivers, so the above site is the only unofficial list of compatible drivers for Windows 8.  I updated to the latest Intel Wireless Driver, and it is all now working!</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/update-to-interesting-windows-phone-build-error/" itemprop="url">Update to Interesting Windows Phone Build Error</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<h1>Windows Phone 8 handling of WPAppmanifest.xml has changed in Visual Studio 2012</h1>

<p>Last year, I <a href="http://gep13.me/VoDIGy">blogged about an interesting build error</a> that I had noticed in a Windows Phone 7 application that I was creating.  This error circled around a problem that occurred when you had a very long name in the author property within the WMAppManifest.xml file.  The error that was reported in the Error Window was fairly cryptic:</p>

<blockquote>“Manifest validation failed: AppManifestInvalidAuthor”</blockquote>


<p>But after a bit of googling, I was able to find out what the problem was.  In all honesty, it was a very rare error, and it came down to a naming convention that I was using for a set of sample applications that I was creating, however, it was still slightly annoying!</p>

<h1>Things are better in Visual Studio 2012</h1>

<p>I am happy to report, that things have improved, a lot, in this area within Visual Studio 2012.  Firstly, you don&rsquo;t have to edit the WMAppManifest.xml file by hand.  Visual Studio 2012 now includes a designer that sits on top of this XML file, as shown here:</p>

<p>[gallery type=&ldquo;rectangular&rdquo; ids=&ldquo;1867,1868,1869,1870&rdquo;]</p>

<p>This editor exists for both Windows Phone 7.1 and Windows Phone 8.0 applications.  You can of course continue to edit the XML directly (if you are that way inclined):</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_1871&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;1142&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/edit_WMAppManifest_File_Directly.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/edit_WMAppManifest_File_Directly.png" alt="Edit WMAppManifest.xml directly" /></a> Edit WMAppManifest.xml directly[/caption]</p>

<p>But doing so means that you lose the ability to get immediate feedback on the state of your WMAppManifest.xml file, as shown here:</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_1872&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;904&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/WMAppManifest_Editor_Error.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/WMAppManifest_Editor_Error.png" alt="WMAppManifest Editor showing error" /></a> WMAppManifest Editor showing error[/caption]</p>

<p>This is a really great addition to Visual Studio, and another example of how Microsoft are ensuring that the end to end development experience is getting much better.  I first noticed this type of editor on top of XML files in Visual Studio 2010 when doing SharePoint development, and this is another very welcome addition!</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/audible-well-yes-but-barely/" itemprop="url">Audible? Well, Yes, but Barely&#8230;</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<h1>I really like the Audible service, but&hellip;</h1>

<p>About two months ago, I started using the <a href="http://www.audible.co.uk/">Audible Audio Book service from Amazon</a>.  I first heard about it while listening to the <a href="http://twit.tv/ww">Windows Weekly</a> podcast.  I was intrigued by the ability to &ldquo;read&rdquo; a book while driving, out walking, doing the dishes, etc, so I thought I would take up the offer to try the service for free.</p>

<p>Put simply, the service is very good.  They have an amazing selection of audio books, and the production of the books is very good!</p>

<p>However, that isn&rsquo;t the whole story.  A service like this is only as good as the applications for it.  As most of you will know, I have a Nokia Lumia 920 (which runs Windows Phone 8 operating system) and unfortunately, the application experience is far more satisfactory!</p>

<h1>How I use the application</h1>

<p>During my half hour commute to work, I normally listen to the radio, however, once i started using Audible, I thought that this would be an ideal time to &ldquo;read&rdquo; a book.  My Ford Focus includes the ability to use a Bluetooth connection with a phone to make and receive calls, and also to transfer Bluetooth Audio.  It also comes with a USB connection into the glove compartment, however, using Bluetooth Audio is just easier.</p>

<h1>The Problems</h1>

<p>I have noticed the following problems with the Windows Phone 8 Audible application:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If the application is running while an incoming phone call comes in, the application doesn&rsquo;t start the audio again.</p></li>
<li><p>If th</p></li>
<li><p>e application is running while an incoming text message comes in, the application doesn&rsquo;t start the audio again.</p></li>
<li><p>I also noticed a crash of the application when I received a &ldquo;mention&rdquo; notification from the Rowi Twitter Application.  This may have been coincidental, however, I thought that it was worth mentioning</p></li>
<li><p>When trying to start the audio again from a saved bookmark, it either doesn&rsquo;t start at all (have to switch the phone off and on</p></li>
</ul>


<p>All of these problems were noted when reading the first book that I purchased, the Steve Jobs Biography.  Towards the end of the book, I started listening simply through the speaker on the phone, which turned out to be a much better experience, but still not perfect.  However, things have taken a turn for the worse.  I purchased my second book, The Hobbit, Part 1, and every time I try to open the book, the application simply crashes.  I have tried rebooting the phone, re-downloading the application, all to no avail!</p>

<h1>Contacting Support</h1>

<p>I decided that it would be a good idea to get in touch with the Audible Support Team, as I wondered if some of the above were known issues, that could be corrected.  I sent them an email, and went into a fair bit of detail, and also offered to provide more information if required, however, the response was slightly disappointing:</p>

<blockquote>Based on the issues you are experiencing it seems that the current installation of the app on your device is corrupted in this case you will need to remove the app and do newly installation:

To uninstall the application from a Windows Phone, attempt the following:

1. Tap on the Start, then flick the screen left
2. Locate the icon for the Audible for Windows Application
3. Tap and hold on the icon until the option to uninstall appears, then tap on it.
4. When prompted to confirm the removal of the application, tap on Yes to complete the uninstall

One the app is removed please restart the device and reinstall it.</blockquote>


<p>I really didn&rsquo;t expect this to make any difference, and I was right.  I went ahead and carried out the above, but the problems still persisted.</p>

<p>I also sent a bug report through regarding the crashing of the application I try to open The Hobbit book, and in almost a week, I have had no response from the support team :-(</p>

<h1>What next?</h1>

<p>At this rate, as much as it pains me to do it as I really like the service, if this immediate problem of the constantly crashing application is not resolved, I feel I am going to have to cancel my subscription to Audible.</p>

<p>Has anyone else seen any problems like this?</p>

<p>Is this the Audible application at fault?  Or is it the bluetooth problems that I have heard about on Twitter?  Any help in this matter would be greatly appreciated!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<h1>New Synaptics Driver means Windows 8 Gestures now work on my Dell Studio 1558</h1>

<p>Out of the box, installing Windows 8 onto my Dell Studio 1558 meant that the Windows 8 Gestures for my Trackpad (i.e. pinch to zoom, two finger vertical scroll, and two finger horizontal scroll) didn&rsquo;t work.  Dell offered an updated trackpad driver, but this didn&rsquo;t seem to work.</p>

<p>In all honesty, I didn&rsquo;t really miss not having it, as typically I use a portable USB Wireless mouse when out and about.  However, after watching Scott Hanselman&rsquo;s (<a href="https://twitter.com/shanselman">@shanselman</a>) <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheMissingWindows8InstructionalVideo.aspx">25 minute introduction video to Windows 8</a>, I decided that it was time to try to get this working!</p>

<p>After a bit of searching, I turned up this <a href="http://www.synaptics.com/resources/drivers">page</a>, which seemed to be exactly what I needed.  I was holding out too much hope, as I had tried a previous version of the Synaptics Driver, and it also hadn&rsquo;t worked.  To my surprise, and delight, I am happy to say that it is now working!</p>

<p>If you are not familiar with the gestures that I am referring to be sure to check out Paul Thurrott&rsquo;s (<a href="http://twitter.com/thurrott">@thurrott</a>) blog post <a href="http://winsupersite.com/windows-8/windows-8-tip-use-trackpad-multi-touch-gestures">here</a>, as it has all the details.</p>

<p>I can see me using these gestures more and more when using my laptop, and only cracking out the mouse when doing more intense stuff on the laptop.</p>

<p>Although out of the box TeamCity uses an internal database based on the HSQLDB database engine, if you are planning on using a TeamCity instance for Production purposes, it is <a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/TCD7/Setting+up+an+External+Database">strongly recommended</a> that you set up an external database connection for it to use.  To that end, this blog post uses a MySQL Database as the external connection for TeamCity.</p>

<h1>Installation Steps</h1>

<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>The following installation steps and screenshots were taken from a virtual machine   with Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1, running in Hyper-V on a Windows 8 Host Machine.</p>

<p>These instructions are specific to version 7.1.3 of TeamCity, however, later versions will likely follow very similar steps.  In addition, these installation instructions will install both the TeamCity Server and Build Agent onto the same machine.  Ideally, you would want to have a separate Build Agent Machine.</p>

<p>You can see screenshots of each of these steps in the galley at the bottom of this blog post.</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Assumption is that you already have <a href="http://gep13.me/S91bws">MySQL Community Server</a> installed</p></li>
<li><p> Assumption is that you already have <a href="http://gep13.me/WiiHcN">MySQL Workbench</a> installed</p></li>
<li><p> Assumption is that you already have configured a <a href="http://gep13.me/Z3jaBI">Profile Instance, with a database and user</a> that can be used by the TeamCity Server</p></li>
<li><p> Download the <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/download/index.html">latest version of TeamCity from the JetBrains website</a> then double-click the .exe and click Run</p></li>
<li><p> At the first step in the installation wizard simply click Next</p></li>
<li><p> Read the License Agreement and assuming you are happy with it, click &ldquo;I Agree&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p> In the &ldquo;Choose Install Location&rdquo; window, assuming you are happy with the default installation folder, simply click Next, otherwise change it first</p></li>
<li><p> In the &ldquo;Choose Components&rdquo; window choose the components that you want to install.  As already mentioned, we will be installing both the Server and Build Agent on one server.  Click Next</p></li>
<li><p> In the &ldquo;Specify server configuration directory&rdquo; window assuming you are happy with the default location click Next, other change it first</p></li>
<li><p>. The main portion of the installation will start now</p></li>
<li><p>. In the &ldquo;Installation Complete&rdquo; windows, specify the port that you want TeamCity to run under.  I have other services running on this server, so I have chosen to use port 8080.  Choose something that won&rsquo;t conflict, and then click Next</p></li>
<li><p>. The &ldquo;Configure Build Agent Properties&rdquo; window will then open, giving you the opportunity to add/edit build agent properties.  For now, you can leave this as the default.  If needed, this can be changed later.  Click Save.</p></li>
<li><p>. Simply click OK on the &ldquo;TeamCity Build Agent Properties&rdquo; pop-up</p></li>
<li><p>. In the &ldquo;Select Service Account for Server&rdquo; window decide what user account you want to run the TeamCity Server, I chose to use the SYSTEM account.  Click Next</p></li>
<li><p>. In the &ldquo;Select Service Account for Agent&rdquo; window decide what user account you want to run the TeamCity Build Agent, I chose to use the SYSTEM account.  Click Next</p></li>
<li><p>. In the &ldquo;Services&rdquo; window, choose to start both the Server and Build Agent Services, and click Next</p></li>
<li><p>. In the final screen, ensure that the option to open TeamCity Website after exit is checked and click Finish.</p></li>
<li><p>. You will then be taken to the default start screen, which as mentioned will create the internal database that TeamCity would normally use by default.  Go ahead and click Proceed, we will then begin editing the configuration to use a MySQL Server Database.</p></li>
<li><p>. A web page will open saying &ldquo;TeamCity is starting&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>. Once this page reloads, and show the license agreement page, open windows explorer and navigate to the configuration directory, the default is C:\ProgramData\JetBrains\TeamCity</p></li>
<li><p>. Open the services snap-in and stop both the TeamCity Build Agent and TeamCity Server services</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Hit the Start button</p></li>
<li><p>Type &ldquo;services.msc&rdquo; and press Enter</p></li>
<li><p>Find each named service and click stop</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>. Back to Windows Explorer, navigate into the configuration folder.  Find the database.mysql.properties.dist file.  Copy and paste this file, and rename the newly created file as database.properties (NOTE: This name is very important.  Compare to the screenshot below to ensure it is correct.</p></li>
<li><p>. Open the database.properties file and notice the section that you have to update</p></li>
<li><p>. Make the necessary changes and save the file (NOTE: I have added an extra configuration line to use UTF-8 character encoding, which if you followed the <a href="http://gep13.me/Z3jaBI">Profile Instance, with a database and user</a> is what your database will use</p></li>
<li><p>. Open an internet browser and download the latest JDBC driver for MySQL.  The main download site can be found <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>. Browse to where you downloaded the driver and extract the contents of the download.  Find the .jar file and copy this into the lib folder within the TeamCity configuration directory.  Typically C:\ProgramData\JetBrains\TeamCity\lib\jdbc</p></li>
<li><p>. Open the services snap-in and start both the TeamCity Server, and TeamCity Build Agent services</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Hit the Start button</p></li>
<li><p>Type &ldquo;services.msc&rdquo; and press Enter</p></li>
<li><p>Find each named service and click start</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>. Open an internet browser and open the TeamCity home page.  As per these installation instructions, that would be <a href="http://localhost:8080,">http://localhost:8080,</a> but the port may be different depending on what you selected.  You will get a warning about the Database being empty.  That is to be expected, as we have only just set this up, and it doesn&rsquo;t contain anything</p></li>
<li><p>. Click the link entitled &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a server administrator, show me the details&rdquo;.  We need to locate the authentication token, before TeamCity will let us continue with the setup.  To do this, we have to open the log file for the TeamCity instance</p></li>
<li><p>. Open windows explorer, and navigate to the TeamCity installation folder, typically this is C:\TeamCity and find the logs folder, and in that folder, the teamcity-server.log.  Open this file.</p></li>
<li><p>. Scroll to the end of this log file, and the last line in the log file should contain the authentication token.  Copy this token to your clipboard</p></li>
<li><p>. Go back to the internet browser, and paste the token and click Confirm.  This will take you to the &ldquo;TeamCity Database Creation&rdquo; window.  Confirm that the details are correct, and click Proceed</p></li>
<li><p>. TeamCity will then create the database and finish configuration setup</p></li>
<li><p>. If you are interested, you can open MySQL Workbench and look at all the tables that have just been created</p></li>
<li><p>. Back in the internet browser, you should be presented with the TeamCity license agreement again.  Read through this, and when happy click the &ldquo;Accept license agreement&rdquo; check box, and then click Continue</p></li>
<li><p>. Enter the details for an administrator account that you will use to administer this TeamCity instance and click Create Account</p></li>
<li><p>. Job done!</p></li>
</ol>


<p>You can see screenshots of each of these steps in the galley at the bottom of this blog post.</p>

<p>There are still steps remaining in terms of setting up projects, build configurations, and other TeamCity settings, but these will be topics for other blog posts.</p>

		<h1>Creating a MySQL Server Instance Profile with a Database and User</h1>

<p>Assuming that you have a MySQL Server installation on your machine, it is normally necessary to configure both a Server Instance Profile, and at least one database to be used within that Instance Profile.  The following steps walk through the necessary steps to do this, using an example of creating a Database that could be used for a TeamCity installation.  Some of the steps are specific to this end goal, however, the steps should be generic enough that they can be tailored to your needs.</p>

<h1>Configuration Steps</h1>

<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>The following installation steps and screenshots were taken from a virtual machine   with Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1, running in Hyper-V on a Windows 8 Host Machine.</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Assumption is that you already have <a href="http://gep13.me/S91bws">MySQL Community Server</a> installed</p></li>
<li><p> Assumption is that you already have <a href="http://gep13.me/WiiHcN">MySQL Workbench</a> installed</p></li>
<li><p> Open MySQL Workbench</p></li>
<li><p> Click on the &ldquo;New Server Instance&rdquo; link</p></li>
<li><p> In the &ldquo;Specify Host Machine&rdquo; Window leave as default and click Next</p></li>
<li><p> In the &ldquo;Database Connection&rdquo; Window leave as default and click Next</p></li>
<li><p> On the &ldquo;Test DB Connection&rdquo; Window ensure that all tested passed and click Next</p></li>
<li><p> Before the next step, we need a Configuration File that MySQL Server can use to instantiate the Server Instance.  The default MySQL Server installation comes with pre-configured configuration files, located at C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.5 (where 5.5. is the version number of MySQL Server you have installed)</p></li>
<li><p> Copy the sample Configuration File that you want to have (I chose my-small) to another location on your hard drive.  For simplicity I chose the root of the C:\ drive, and I renamed the file to my.ini.</p></li>
<li><p>. In the &ldquo;Windows Management&rdquo; window browse to the location that you copied the configuration file and select it. Press Next.</p></li>
<li><p>. In the &ldquo;Test Settings&rdquo; window ensure that all test passed and click Next</p></li>
<li><p>. Click &ldquo;Continue&rdquo; when the &ldquo;Review Settings&rdquo; pop-up appears</p></li>
<li><p>. In the &ldquo;Complete Setup&rdquo; window click Finish</p></li>
<li><p>. Once back at the home page of MySQL Workbench, double-click on the instance that you have just created</p></li>
<li><p>. In the Admin tab, select &ldquo;Users and Privileges&rdquo; and click &ldquo;Add Account&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>. Enter the details for the user that you want to create, in this case I have chosen &ldquo;teamcity&rdquo; as the username and entered a password for this user.  Once completed, click Apply.</p></li>
<li><p>. Go back to the home page of MySQL Workbench by clicking the Home tab</p></li>
<li><p>. Double click onto the localhost connection</p></li>
<li><p>. Click the Create Schema button, and provide a name for the schema, I have chosen teamcity, and then click Apply</p></li>
<li><p>. On the &ldquo;Review SQL Script&rdquo; window click Apply</p></li>
<li><p>. On the &ldquo;Apply SQL Script&rdquo; window click Finish</p></li>
<li><p>. The <a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/TCD7/Configuring+UTF8+Character+Set+for+MySQL">recommended Collation and Charset for using TeamCity</a> (the application that is going to be using this database is utf8 - utf8_bin, if you require this, select this in the drop down list and click Apply</p></li>
<li><p>. On the &ldquo;Review SQL Script&rdquo; window click Apply</p></li>
<li><p>. On the &ldquo;Apply SQL Script&rdquo; window click Finish</p></li>
<li><p>. Return to the Admin screen by clicking on that tab</p></li>
<li><p>. Select &ldquo;Users and Privileges&rdquo; and click on the &ldquo;Schema Privileges&rdquo; tab and select the User that you want to create a permission for, and then click Add Entry</p></li>
<li><p>. In the &ldquo;New Schema Privilege Definition&rdquo; window select which hosts you want this user to be able to access the schema from (I have chosen to limit this to localhost, which is the most secure.  Also, map the user to the schema that you want them to access.  Again in this case, I have chosen the teamcity schema, so there is a mapping between the teamcity user and schema.  Once completed, click OK</p></li>
<li><p>. Once back at the main window, click &ldquo;Select &#8220;ALL&rdquo; to give this user all database permissions (you may want to only select certain options, depending on what you require).  Once you are happy, click &ldquo;Save Changes&rdquo;</p></li>
</ol>
