<h1>First Morning Session at DevWeek Day 3</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Richard Blewett (you can find him on twitter <a href="http://www.dotnetconsult.co.uk/weblog2/">@richardblewett</a> and his <a href="http://www.dotnetconsult.co.uk/weblog2/">blog</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Topic: </strong>What’s new in WCF 4.5</p>

<blockquote>The WCF team has been busy. WCF 4.5 comes with a host of new features: further configuration simplifications, WebSockets support, contract first development and more. This session shows you the new features, explains why they were introduced, and examines what impact they will have on the way you build distributed systems.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>I know a lot of people slate WCF, and haven’t got anything good to say about it, but my experience has been that it works for what it was intended, and we have used it with a lot of success in-house.  I was very keen to see what features were coming in 4.5, and I wasn’t disappointed.  Richard was able to fully explain the up and coming features, even though he did have some issues with his Windows 8 Virtual Machine and Virtual Box near the start of the session.  If you are interested in seeing what it on offer, I would highly recommend taking a look at the slides for this session when they are made available on the DevWeek website.  One of the many interesting features that comes with this release is the ability to implement UDP and a true “fire and forget” broadcast of messages, which as demonstrated in the session is quicker than standard TCP (assuming of course that you are able to handle the potential for missed packets).</p>

<h1>Second Morning Session at DevWeek Day 3</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Jeff Prosise (you can find him on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jprosise">@jprosise</a> and his <a href="http://www.wintellect.com/cs/blogs/jprosise/">blog</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Topic: </strong>Building cross-platform mobile applications with HTML5 and PhoneGap</p>

<blockquote>Windows Phone 7 is a great platform, but the greatest challenge facing mobile developers today is writing apps that run on all the popular mobile platforms. With HTML5 and PhoneGap, you can write apps that exploit native features of the operating system and run on a wide range of devices. And the recently released PhoneGap 1.3 makes Windows Phone 7 a first-class citizen in the PhoneGap environment. Join the fun as Jeff explores the world of cross-platform mobile development and demonstrates the pros and cons of going HTML5 versus going native.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>Although I had attended Jeff’s full day session on HTML5, I was so impressed with him as a speaker that I decided to check out this session as well.  Once again, Jeff simply told you straight what was good and what wasn’t.  Although the idea of developing once and deploying everywhere is an appealing thought, in practice, the result is not always perfect.  The examples that Jeff showed where he made use of the device accelerometer, and also populating a ListBox full of contacts showed that the performance of the resulting application was not up to scratch.  Although it was “ok” it isn’t really something that you would like to put into the hands of a customer.  Now, admittedly, some of the performance issues were down to the browser on the phone, for instance the handling of CSS in Internet Explorer on the Windows Phone 7 device, however, most of the issues are down to the interfacing between JavaScript and the native phone functions.  This is likely something that will improve over time, and the ideal that is develop once and deploy everywhere may become a true option.  For now, depending on the type of application that you are creating, using a technology such as PhoneGap won’t cut it, however, it is a technology that I will be keeping an eye on.  Another great session from Jeff, thanks!</p>

<h1>First Afternoon Session at DevWeek Day 3</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Matt Milner (you can find him on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/milnertweet">@milnertweet</a> and his <a href="http://mattmilner.com/blog/">blog</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Topic: </strong>OData everywhere!</p>

<blockquote>More and more servers and systems are providing access to their data via OData, the open standard protocol for data exchange on the internet. In this session learn how to use your .NET skills to publish and consume that data from a variety of clients. We will start by showing the very elegant .NET client solution for OData services, and quickly move into the different libraries available for each client platform to understand the unique features and constraints of each.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>DevWeek really has been full of great sessions, and this one was no different.  Matt is a great speaker, and it is easy to see why Pluralsight have picked him up as an author for their videos.  This time the topic was OData, again, another technology that we make use of from time to time.  The big selling point of OData is that once you have used it in one place, the interface and integration of it in another system, is very similar.  Granted, the data that is being exposed is going to change, but the way in which it is accessed is exactly the same, so you don’t have to worry about re-learning another system, each time you want to use it.  The new tooling support that comes in .NET 4.5 and Visual Studio 11 extends the already existing functionality to make working with OData trivial, both on the server and on the client.  There were a lot of take away points from this session for me, not least the tooling the is available on the OData Eco System to make working with OData that bit easier.</p>

<h1>Second Afternoon Session at DevWeek Day 3</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Christian Weyer (you can find him on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/christianweyer">@christianweyer</a> and his <a href="http://weblogs.thinktecture.com/cweyer/">blog</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Topic: </strong>Real-world experience with Windows Azure</p>

<blockquote>No doubt: cloud computing is here. And we as .NET-branded developers can participate in the big game with the Windows Azure platform. In this session Christian reports first experiences from real world projects and demonstrates a couple of lessons-learned and various good practices. A number of things are very different when you are running on a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) like Windows Azure and the earlier you know and think about them the better it will be for your eventual cloud success. Come and hear about Azure-related topics like cost-oriented architecture, development & deployment, diagnostics & monitoring, optimisation or handling databases</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>Wow!  Just wow!  Hands down, I think that this was the most enjoyable session that I went to at DevWeek.  I have to say a big congratulations to Christian, he is very good at what he does, and like some of the other presenters at DevWeek he simply don’t it like it is, which is something that I really enjoyed about DevWeek.  On his opening slide, Christian had two sections, “What to expect” and “What not to expect”, one of which was “No Marketing FUD!”</p>

<p>Having looked at Windows Azure for a while now, but never actually getting a chance to use it in anger, I was very curious to hear about how Windows Azure had been used in the wild, and Christian was very much able to deliver on this.  He had a number of real life applications, some of which he was even able to show us running live in the cloud.  He was even able to deal with what were probably my annoying questions from the back of the room, and I can honestly say that I got a huge amount of information from this session, thank you very much!</p>

<p>Two stand out items from this talk, for me, were the correct pronunciation of the word “Azure” (he had a WAV file that explained exactly how to say it) and also an explanation of what the word Azure actually means.  If you are unsure, take a look at the Wikipedia article for Azure, specifically about how it relates to clouds <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/wlEmoticon-smile1.png" alt="Smile" />.</p>

<p>However, hands down, the most interesting demonstration was the ability to push a zip file, which contains an entire website into Blob Storage, and then have a background task running on a Web Role pick this up, and deploy it into IIS and start-up the site.  This was an amazing demonstration! Simply put, a lot of people complain about the start-up time of a Windows Azure deployment, but this demonstration showed an entire web site being deployed within a minute!  Although this is custom code running in his Cloud instance, Christian did hint at the fact that functionality such as this may well be making it into an Azure Platform near you in 2012.  Exciting times!</p>

<h1>First Morning Session at DevWeek Day 2</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Mike Taulty (you can find him on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/mtaulty">@mtaulty</a> and his <a href="http://mtaulty.com/communityserver/blogs/mike_taultys_blog/default.aspx">blog</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Topic: </strong>Technical Keynote – Windows 8 for application developers</p>

<blockquote>Windows 8 is Windows re-imagined for new devices, form-factors and chipsets embracing and unifying touch as a first-class input mechanism and providing a new platform for fast and fluid Metro style applications that put the application and the user front and centre. Developing Metro style applications involves a new set of tooling in Visual Studio and new versions of Expression Blend where you can author your UI in HTML or XAML and write your logic in JavaScript, C# or C++. The new WinRT runtime provides APIs that expose platform capabilities like storage, networking, media and also provides access to the contracts that let Windows loosely link your applications with others on the user’s machine.
This session will set the scene for the Windows 8 operating system and Windows 8 “Metro Style” applications, and the huge opportunity that they offer you as an application developer.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>For a lot of reasons, I have not been in a position to play with either Windows 8 or Visual Studio 11.  I have both of the Developer previews downloaded but I haven’t installed them.  As a result, it was great to see both of these items being used in anger, and Mike Taulty provided a very good overview of how the twos things can be used together.</p>

<p>There were a couple of times when the demonstration didn’t go quite the way that I think Mike wanted it to, but if this in any way flustered him, it wasn’t obvious.  The problems that did crop up were nothing major and to be expected with running a Consumer Technical Preview on a prototype device.</p>

<p>Of particular interest was seeing how .NET assemblies could be created and consumed within a Metro Application using HTML5 and JavaScript.  This did involve jumping through a few hoops by first converting the Project Type to use WinMD, and also meant creating a “copy” of the returned object since it couldn’t be used directly.  All in all though, it was a very impressive demonstration of what could be done.</p>

<p>A couple interesting links that came out of the session:</p>

<h1>Second Morning Session at DevWeek Day 2</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Dino Esposito (you can find him on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/despos">@despos</a> and his <a href="http://www.expoware.org/">site</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Topic: </strong>ASP.NET MVC: Programming for the real world</p>

<blockquote>You cannot realistically write an ASP.NET MVC controller class without making extensive use of action filters. In ASP.NET MVC, an action filter affects the way in which controller methods execute. An action filter can be used to trap exceptions, authorise access, cache output, and validate requests. This is only the first stage of flexibility, however. In this session, we’ll first see how to create custom filters to perform a variety of custom tasks including compressing the response, adapting to the browser, filling up view dependencies. Up to here, however, filters are only attached to methods statically. The next step consists of defining an infrastructure for you to load filters dynamically thus gaining the ability to toggle certain behaviour on or off on the fly.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>Having read the description for this session, I was very much looking forward to it.  I have never seen a presentation from Dino before, but it has to be said that he is a very good presenter!  He is obviously very passionate about the topic, and you can’t help but get swept up in his enthusiasm!</p>

<p>The main topic of this presentation was the use of Action Filters, and how these can be used to make your code more readable (the main point that Dino was trying to push throughout the session).</p>

<p>It was very interesting to see how an Action Filter can be used to intercept:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The start of the request</p></li>
<li><p>The end of the request</p></li>
<li><p>The start of the response</p></li>
<li><p>The end of the response</p></li>
</ul>


<p>and how code could be applied at any of these points.  One of the examples that was shown was the inclusion of logging to record how long the request took to execute.  Very interesting.</p>

<p>Dino then went on to show how the necessary Action Filter Attributes out of the code file into the configuration file, and then injected into the code.  The only problem that I had with this is that it potentially made the code “less” readable.  Without looking at the configuration file, in conjunction with the source code, there was no way to see which Action Filters were being applied where.</p>

<h1>First Afternoon Session at DevWeek Day 2</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Robert Boedigheimer (you can find him on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/boedie">@boedie</a> and his <a href="http://aspadvice.com/blogs/robertb">blog</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Topic: </strong>ASP.NET and Visual Studio 11</p>

<blockquote>Learn about the great new features coming in the next version of ASP.NET and Visual Studio. There are some great enhancements to all of the editors (CSS snippets, CSS vendor prefixes, JavaScript go to definition, etc). Discover the new model binding and repository capabilities in Web Forms, along with unobtrusive jQuery validation support for validators. See how to bundle and minify CSS and JavaScript files simply to drastically improve web site performance. A new script manager also supports debug, release, and CDN versions of files</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>As mentioned above, I haven’t played with Visual Studio 11, so I was very interested to see the changes that were coming in it.  The fact that the session was going to be focused on ASP.NET was a bit of a bonus!</p>

<p>Bottom line, ignoring all the arguments about the colour and icons and whether this is good or bad, the new Visual Studio has some very interesting features!  Some of the stand out items for me included:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Image Thumbnails in the Solution Explorer – very cool!</p></li>
<li><p>The new Preview Tab which brings up the file with a single click in the Solution Explorer</p></li>
<li><p>Matching tag renaming in the Source Editor</p></li>
<li><p>Attribute Code Intellisense</p></li>
<li><p>New Page Inspector which combines F12 Developer Tools type functionality directly in Visual Studio</p></li>
<li><p>Built in minification of CSS and JavaScript files, including ability to provide a hash code to the resulting bundle to ensure re-download when changes occur on the server</p></li>
<li><p>Support for HTML 5 Types from the TextBox Server Control</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Overall, I really enjoyed this session, not least because Robert is a very good speaker, there are a lot of great features going in this next release of Visual Studio and I am very much looking forward to starting to use it.  The fact that you can “round trip” projects between Visual Studio 11 and Visual Studio 2010 (assuming you don’t use any new features in .NET 4.5) will make the transition to this use IDE much easier!</p>

<h1>Second Afternoon Session at DevWeek Day 2</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Dave Wheeler (you can find him on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/coloringinguy">@coloringinguy</a> and his <a href="http://coloringinguy.com/">blog</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Topic: </strong>A .NET developer’s guide to WinRT</p>

<blockquote>Come to this session to find out how to consume and interact with WinRT from managed code.
Learn how to write WinRT components; how to integrate them with C++ and JavaScript code; and just how natural and fluid it is to work with WinRT from managed code.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>Having listened to Mike Taulty’s keynote speech around Metro and WinRT, I was hoping to get some more information regarding the innards of developing with it in this session, and I wasn’t disappointed.  Dave did a great job of cutting through some the marketing regarding Metro and WinRT and basically told it how it is.  This is not to say that he slated Metro or WinRT in any way, that certainly wasn’t the case, but rather, simply told it how it is.</p>

<p>He made is clear that much like it was with Silverlight Development, certain things will not be available when doing Metro Development.  This is due to the new .Net Core Profile.  For instance, although you will be able to use LINQ to Objects, there is no LINQ to SQL, or LINQ to Entities.  This is mainly due to the fact that there is no support for ADO.NET in WinRT.</p>

<p>As with the other talks today, this one was also very good, and it ended a very enjoyable first day of sessions at DevWeek.</p>

		<p>What follows is a brief summary of the final day of <a href="http://www.devweek.com/">DevWeek 2012</a>.  It has been a very long, but also a very enjoyable, week and I have to give a lot of credit of all of the organisers, speakers and sponsors for putting on a great conference.  Congratulations to Nick Payne of <a href="http://www.bearpark.co.uk/">Bearkpark Publishing</a> for organising everything!  Reviews of the other days of DevWeek can be seen here:</p>

<h1>Post-Conference Workshop at DevWeek</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter:</strong> Kevin Jones (you can find him on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/kevinrjones">@kevinrjones</a> and his <a href="http://www.rocksolidknowledge.com/">site</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Topic:</strong> A day of unit testing</p>

<blockquote>Unit testing has become more prevalent over the last few years as more and more teams have come to realise the importance of ensuring code has some degree of test coverage. Developers are aware that code quality is an important issue and that to get high quality code they often need to refactor. Refactoring safely requires unit tests. We will spend the day looking at unit testing, how to write a unit test, how to test external resources such as databases and web services, how to work with legacy code and how to ensure that your code is designed to be tested.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> I actually got a lot from this session.  Not only is Kevin a great speaker, but he was able to provide lots of real life experiences with regard to how he has used Unit Testing in the various jobs that he has had.  I have done a lot of reading on the subject of Unit Testing but for one reason or another have not been able to fully implement at my place of work the way that I would like to.  What I particularly liked about this session was the pragmatic approach that Kevin used to implementing Unit Testing.</p>

<p>In this day long session, Kevin talked through lots of topics that you would expect in a session like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Unit Testing</p></li>
<li><p>Integration Testing</p></li>
<li><p>Mocking</p></li>
<li><p>Dependency Injection</p></li>
<li><p>Inversion of Control</p></li>
</ul>


<p>However, what was really impressive about this session was the final demonstration which brought everything together into one concrete demonstration application.  This included:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Starting with a blank ASP.NET MVC Application which would use Unity</p></li>
<li><p>Adding a new Integration Test Project and added Specflow, Selenium and NUnit</p></li>
<li><p>Adding a new Unit Test Project and added NUnit</p></li>
<li><p>Created a Specflow Feature and Scenario and saw it fail</p></li>
<li><p>Created some Unit Tests and saw them fail</p></li>
<li><p>Implemented the necessary code, i.e. Controller and View to make the tests pass</p></li>
<li><p>Refactored the code to include repository pattern for Database access using Entity Framework and Unity for injecting a repository instance whilst ensuring Tests continued to pass, as well as mocking the repository for testing purposes</p></li>
</ul>


<p>All in all, this single demonstration brought everything together for me, and it really hammered home all the topics of the day.  Very well done!!</p>

<p>In addition, Kevin is also working on a blog application which demonstrates the use of all of these frameworks and strategies.  You can find this on his GiHub account <a href="https://github.com/kevinrjones/mblog">here</a>.  Bear in mind, this application has been created in Visual Studio 11 using .NET Framework 4.5 and the Beta edition of Entity Framework 5, so if you want to play with it, you will need to have all of these installed somewhere.</p>

<p>Thanks for a great session Kevin!!</p>

		<p>This morning I found another notification to indicate that there was an update for my Windows Phone 7, Nokia Lumia 800 Handset.  Given the <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/nokia-lumia-800-to-get-tethering-support-soon/">recent announcement</a>, I hurriedly set about getting the update installed.</p>

<p>In the style of my previous Windows Phone 7 update posts, here are some of the screenshots that I took along the update process:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/2012-03-30_0801.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/2012-03-30_0801_thumb.png" alt="Update for Windows Phone 7 Available" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/2012-03-30_0806.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/2012-03-30_0806_thumb.png" alt="Update Your Phone in Zune" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/2012-03-30_0824.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/2012-03-30_0824_thumb.png" alt="Update of Windows Phone 7 Complete" /></a></p>

<p>As soon as the update was completed, and the Windows Phone 7 handset had rebooted, I straight away went into the Settings menu where I was sure that I was going to find the <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/update-7-10-7710-68-for-windows-phone-7-wp7/">Internet Sharing</a> option, but unfortunately, it is still not there!</p>

<p>On doing some searching, I turned up this <a href="http://discussions.europe.nokia.com/t5/Nokia-with-Windows-Phone/Heads-up-on-Lumia-800-update-1600-2487-8107-12070/td-p/1361057">Nokia Support Discussion</a> which explains that this update does:</p>

<blockquote>

> 
> 
    
>   * brings significant improvements in battery performance, especially in 3G talk time as well as in predictive usage time, standby time, WiFi browsing time and music playback time.
> 
    
>   * Improved bass in audio performance
> 
    
>   * The back, start, and search keys are lit according to screen brightness settings
> 
    
>   * Fix to prevent rebooting in certain network conditions
> 
    
>   * Fix for call hang up issues in certain markets
> 

</blockquote>


<p>These things are all great, and I had actually noticed the rebooting of the phone when starting up initially, so I am glad that this is fixed, however, I still REALLY want to be able to tether my laptop to my Windows Phone 7.</p>

<p>Hopefully the next update from Nokia for the Windows Phone 7 will include this functionality, and further, I hope that my current mobile operator supports this function (which I have been told that they do).</p>

<p>For those interested in version numbers etc, this update took my Windows Phone 7 from:</p>

<p>Firmware Revision Number: <strong>1600.2483.8106.11500 </strong>to <strong>1600.2487.8107.12070</strong></p>

		<p>Today was the first day of <a href="http://www.devweek.com/">DevWeek 2012</a>, and I am happy to say that I have had a great day!  I have never been to DevWeek before, and the format of it is slightly different from other developer events that I have attended.   I am lucky enough to be attending the whole week of events at DevWeek, and today there was a choice of 9 different sessions.  These ranged from “A Day of Metro” to “Agile Primer”.  Reviews of the other days of DevWeek can be seen here:</p>

</ul>


<h1>Pre-Conference Workshop at DevWeek</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Jeff Prosise (you can find his blog <a href="http://www.wintellect.com/cs/blogs/jprosise/">here</a> and his twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jprosise">here</a>:</p>

<p><strong>Topic: </strong>HTML5 Workshop</p>

<blockquote>HTML 5 is the newest version of HTML, and it is taking the programming world by storm. It combines new markup elements with a host of new JavaScript APIs to bring HTML into the 21st century and to enable developers to build rich, feature-filled Web applications without relying on browser plug-ins such as Silverlight and Flash.
In this full-day pre-conference tutorial, we’ll take a deep dive into HTML 5 and show all the bells and whistles, including new markup elements, browser support, audio and video, the canvas API, local storage, web workers, geolocation, and much, much more.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> In house, we are heavily invested in Silverlight, however, HTML 5, although still not officially a standard, and yet to be fully implemented in browsers, is certainly making waves, and I was very interested to hear about what it is, what it does, and what actually works.  The day long workshop was broken up into the following sections:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Introduction</p></li>
<li><p>Geolocation</p></li>
<li><p>Audio and Video</p></li>
<li><p>Canvas</p></li>
<li><p>Web Workers</p></li>
<li><p>Web Storage</p></li>
<li><p>Files</p></li>
<li><p>Drag and Drop</p></li>
<li><p>Networking</p></li>
</ul>


<p>With each section, Jeff had a number of very good demonstrations with he was able to show working (in some cases this meant switching between different browsers), and this really helped to concrete the topics that were being explained.</p>

<p>If you are interested in seeing the demo code, it is available for download <a href="http://wintellect.com/downloads/html5.zip">here</a>.  As a suggestion to Jeff, if he is reading, I think it would be great if these samples were to make them onto something like GitHub.  With the rate at which the HTML 5 specification is evolving, along with changes to browsers implementations, having the code in GitHub would allow it to be easier maintained and updated.  Just an idea.</p>

<p>One thing that I really enjoyed about todays workshops were the synergies that Jeff was able to bring to the table.  With a background in Silverlight, Jeff was able to give honest opinions about how things differed between the two technologies.  Both the good and the bad.  This really helped!!  I think the important thing is going to be knowing when to use HTML 5.  In some places it is going to make sense to use it, in others, continuing to use Silverlight (which is due to be supported for the next 10 years) is still going to make sense.</p>

<p>All in all, Jeff was a great speaker, and I really enjoyed this day long introduction to HTML 5.  I am very much looking forward to the rest of the week, and looking ahead at the sessions available Jeff has a number of other sessions which I am now thinking about attending.  The problem here being that there are SO many good sessions on offer, than choosing between them is going to be very hard!  For the Post Conference Workshop I am signed up for “A day of unit testing” with Kevin Jones, which I think will be a really useful day!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I have just found out that the much-needed internet tethering feature for my Nokia Lumia 800 is coming, it just hasn’t been announced when it will be arriving.  The only hint that we get is via an online <a href="http://nokiaconnects.com/2012/03/13/nokia-lumia-900-your-questions-answered/">Q&amp;A blog post on the Nokia Connects site</a>, which states:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/image.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/image_thumb.png" alt="Nokia Lumia 800 to get tethering support" /></a></p>

<p>This really is great news, and although it has not been confirmed when this update will be shipped, the confirmation that this feature is actually coming to the Nokia Lumia 800 is in itself huge news.</p>

<p>I have recently moved mobile phone operator specifically for the reason that I wanted an unlimited data contract, and the fact that the Nokia Lumia 800 couldn’t tether is a real pain as it means I have to switch SIM between my HTC HD7 which does have the feature.  I personally can’t wait for this update to be released!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Back in June 2011, I asked an <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/can-net-user-groups-get-office365-for-free/">open question</a> to the community regarding Office 365.  The question was simple….</p>

<blockquote>Can .Net User Groups get Office 365 for free?</blockquote>


<p>To me, it seemed like a simple enough question, however, at the time, it seemed that there was no simple answer.  Once the Office 365 Beta that I was using for managing the <a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/">Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group</a> email expired, I transitioned to using a paid P1 plan.  This was for a number of reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> The Office 365 Service is very good!  It does exactly what it says on the tin, and I had already done the hard work of setting up the domain, and getting it all working.</p></li>
<li><p> As I mentioned in my earlier blog post, it is not a huge amount of money for the service, so I was happy to pay for it.  The only slight problem being that other members of the User Group simply use email aliases, rather than having a full-blown mailbox, as we couldn’t warrant paying for an account for everyone.</p></li>
<li><p> There was still no confirmation on whether we could, or could not get it for free.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>However, thanks to an email from Andrew Westgarth (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/apwestgarth">@apwestgarth</a>), I am happy to be able to let you know that through <a href="https://www.technicalcommunity.com/Pages/default.aspx">UGSS</a> (User Group Support Services), it is now possible to get an E3 Office 365 Plan for your User Group.  Full details of the offer can be found here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.microsofttraining.com/office365/">http://www.microsofttraining.com/office365/</a></p>

<p>I have just started the registration process, so I haven’t got this all setup yet, but if I run into any problems, I will let you know.  I am hoping that there isn’t going to be a problem with already having a paid Office 365 Plan, as the registration instructions mention starting a trial Office 365 Plan, but we will wait and see.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I woke up this morning to find that my shiny new Windows Phone 7, the Nokia Lumia 800, was telling me that I had a new update.</p>

<p>As some of you will know, I REALLY like the Nokia Lumia 800, it is a great piece of hardware, but it has one killer feature missing, in my opinion.  This is the ability to tether the phone to my laptop using “Internet Sharing” as I could on my HTC HD7.</p>

<p>I have heard from both parties in this problem, i.e. Nokia and my mobile phone provider, and both say that it “should” work, but alas, it doesn’t.  I was sort of hoping that this new update would bring with it the ability to tether, but alas, it didn’t <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/wlEmoticon-sadsmile.png" alt="Sad smile" />.</p>

<p>In the style of my previous Windows Phone 7 update posts, here is the screen shot that greets you when you start to do this update:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Firmware_Update.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Firmware_Update_thumb.png" alt="Firmware_Update" /></a></p>

<p>This update took my Windows Phone 7 from:</p>

<p>Firmware Revision Number: <strong>1600.2479.7740.11451 </strong>to <strong>1600.2483.8106.11500</strong></p>

<p>Details of what is included in this particular update can be found <a href="http://conversations.nokia.com/2012/01/18/new-software-update-for-the-nokia-lumia-800/">here</a>.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Tonight I started to configure my new Windows Phone 7, the <a href="http://www.nokia.com/gb-en/products/phone/lumia800/">Nokia Lumia 800</a>.  I was lucky enough to receive this phone when I attended the <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/windows-phone-7-bootcamp-uk-tech-days/">Windows Phone 7 Bootcamp</a> in London, which was part of UK Tech Days, which is organised and run by Microsoft.</p>

<p>While doing this, I got a distinct feeling of <em>deja vu</em>, as I recently applied this <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/update-7-10-8107-79-for-windows-phone-7-wp7/">update for my HTC HD7</a>.</p>

<p>In the same way as the last time, the update itself went in without any problems.  One interesting difference between the two updates can be seen in the following screenshot though:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/2012-02-08_2014.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/2012-02-08_2014_thumb.png" alt="2012-02-08_2014" /></a></p>

<p>If you compare this to the previous screenshot, you will see that there is no mention of the “<em>HTC Update for Windows Phone”</em> which was present on the last update screen.</p>

<p>I had heard that mobile phone operators were pushing out their own updates, in this case HTC, but I have never seen it first hand.  It was also my understanding that mobile operators would come out with their own updates, not bundled with an Operating System update, but it appears that this also isn’t the case.</p>

<p>I would have also thought that in this case, the build number would also be different, in order to show what is, and what isn’t installed on a particular handset.  Quite why this hasn’t been done, I am not sure.  Perhaps this is what is included in the firmware version number for the handset.</p>

<p>I am now going through the process of re-installing the applications that I have on my HD7, onto my Lumia.  I asked the question while I was at the Bootcamp whether there was anyway to automate this process, but the answer was no.</p>

<p>One annoyance that I have found with the Nokia Lumia 800 is that at the minute, even after applying the latest update, the Internet Sharing function for the phone is not available.  Any noted <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/update-7-10-7710-68-for-windows-phone-7-wp7/">here</a> this is a fundamental feature on my current handset, and I am going to miss having it.  While I was at the Bootcamp I specifically asked the Nokia representative whether this feature was going to be available on the Lumia, and I was told that it would. be, assuming that the Mobile Operator enabled it.  However, after talking directly to 3 this afternoon, they are saying that it is Nokia that need to first enable this feature.</p>

<p>Having done some googling, it is not clear to me at this point who is right and who is wrong.  Even on Nokia’s own support forum there are <a href="http://discussions.europe.nokia.com/t5/Nokia-with-Windows-Phone/Internet-sharing-teathering-on-Lumia-800/td-p/1285135">mixed comments</a>.  I have seen references to an update being provided in early 2012, specifically from <a href="http://www.windowsphonedaily.com/2011/12/nokia-italy-internet-sharing-coming-to.html">Nokia Italy</a>.  Hopefully some more concrete news fill be released soon.</p>
