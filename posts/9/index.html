	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>As most of you will know, I have been a long time fan of the author Stuart MacBride. As shown <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=725">here</a>, <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=727">here</a> and <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=399">here</a>.</p>

<p>After I got the new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0007344171/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0007344171">Birthdays for the Dead</a>, delivered, I found out that Stuart was going to be doing a book signing at the local WHSmith in Aberdeen. Book in hand, I decided that I would go along to the book signing. (I have to admit that I checked first in order to make sure that bringing a book that I had already purchased into the book store, but I was told that this would be ok, but I took the receipt just to be on the safe side <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/wlEmoticon-smile3.png" alt="Smile" />). Although not ideal for me, I am happy to report that the queue for getting the book signed was massive. I knew that Stuart was a popular author in the North East, but to get such a turn out was great to see. Congratulations!</p>

<p>With some time to kill while I was in the queue, I started to read the book, and I have to say, so far so good <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/wlEmoticon-smile3.png" alt="Smile" />. I will keep you posted on how it goes.</p>

<p>For those interested, here is the result of waiting in the queue:</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/continue-using-wordpress-or-not/" itemprop="url">Continue Using WordPress, or Not?</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>In one way or another, I have had a blog since the start of 2008. This started out as a custom blog with I created in ASP.Net. This was hosted on my own server in the house, using Red Hat Linux, MySQL and Mono (using the mod_mono Apache Module). This was set up as more of an experiment than anything, just to prove that you could happily run an ASP.Net application on top of Linux, and by the start of 2009 I wasn’t really using the blog anymore. Back in May 2011, I decided that I wanted to start blogging “properly” again. This decision was taken for a number of reasons, but mainly due to the fact that I had started getting more involved in the UK .Net Development Community and I wanted somewhere to record what was going on, and so this WordPress blog was born.</p>

<p>Being a .Net Developer, my intention was always to start using one of the .Net Blogging systems such as <a href="http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/">BlogEngine</a>, <a href="http://dasblog.info/">dasBlog</a>, or <a href="http://subtextproject.com/default.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1">Subtext</a>, however, due to time constraints at the time, I set up this WordPress blog. This was ridiculously simple to do, and I was very quickly able to set up the blog as I wanted it, with pages, contact form, and blog entries. There was very little that I could fault with WordPress. The sheer volume of plugins that it has means that if you want to add something to your blog, such as Galleries, Comment Management, Syntax Highlighting, you can simply add it. And, best of all, normally, this doesn’t cost you anything.</p>

<p>For the next year or so, I was quite happy using the WordPress system, and it wasn’t until I set up the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group site with <a href="http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/">BlogEngine</a>, that I started to wonder whether I wanted to move this blog onto another system. I started doing some investigation, and there are a number of tutorials out there that show you the steps that you need to take in order to migrate a WordPress blog onto another system. The more I thought about it, the more I thought that I was going to go ahead and move it. At least that way, if there was “something” that I wanted to add to the blog system, be it another module, or function, then in theory (given that I am a .Net Developer and that a new system would be based on .Net) I should quite easily be able to add it.</p>

<p>However, recently, a number of things have happened that are making me to rethink this decision.</p>

<ol>
<li><p> I attended <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=569">GiveCamp UK</a> and worked on a WordPress site and I got to see more into the innards of WordPress and saw that it isn’t that “bad” to tinker with, as I had previously thought</p></li>
<li><p> I found an amazing Metro WordPress Theme thanks to <a href="http://www.pedrolamas.com/2011/12/21/metro-cimbalino-wordpress-theme/">Pedro Lamas</a></p></li>
<li><p> <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=416">WordPress 3.3.1</a> was released and it is quite simply, amazing!</p></li>
<li><p> I installed a few new WordPress Plugins that contained the last remaining functionality that I was looking for on my blog, namely <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/backupwordpress/">BackUpWordPress</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/disqus-comment-system/">Disqus Comment System</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/feedburner-setting/">FeedBurner FeedSmith Extend</a>, <a href="http://alexrabe.de/wordpress-plugins/nextgen-gallery/">NextGen Gallery</a>, and <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/now-reading-reloaded/">Now Reading Reloaded</a>, (If you are interested in seeing all the WordPress plugins that I currently use, take a look at this <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=174">blog post</a>).</p></li>
</ol>


<p>The Now Reading plugin doesn’t “quite” do exactly what I want, but I think I am now prepared to invest the time to get it working the way I want it.</p>

<p>So what does all this mean?</p>

<p>Unless someone can convince me to the contrary, I am going to continue using WordPress.</p>

<p>It is VERY good at what it does, and I don’t see any killer feature in any of the other systems that would make me want to switch. Granted, it is created in PHP, and this is not something that I am overly familiar with, but using it also forces me to get my toes wet with PHP, which when it comes to becoming a “well-rounded” developer is far from a bad thing. To this end, over the last week or so I have added a few more things to the blog. This includes, as mentioned, the Now Reading plugin which you can see in action <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?now_reading_library=true">here</a> (expect to see some changes to this in the near future), and I have added some photo albums, which you can see <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?page_id=581">here</a>. The majority of these photos come from my old blog back in 2008 (I have also imported the old blog posts from that blog into this one). If anyone is looking for an explanation of what the hell “<strong>Gary The Coconut</strong>” is all about, check out this blog post <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=698">here</a> and <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=694">here</a>.</p>

<p>As always, I would be interested to hear your thoughts on this, so feel free to comment.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/now-using-feedburner-for-blog-site/" itemprop="url">Now Using Feedburner for Blog Site</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I have decided to start using <a href="http://feedburner.google.com/">FeedBurner</a> for managing the Feeds for my blog (If you are not familiar with what FeedBurner is, you can find some more information <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FeedBurner">here</a>). Basically, it will allow me, on top of the Google Analytics that I already have running, to monitor how many people (if any) are actually looking at my blog.</p>

<p>The installation and setup of FeedBurner actually turned out to be quite simple. The one thing that I was worried about was previously subscribed RSS readers not working after the switch. However, with the help of the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/feedburner-setting/">FeedBurner FeedSmith Extend</a> plugin for WordPress, this is all taken care of (and it is actually recommended by FeedBurner during the setup phase. With that in place, and the feeds configured in my FeedBurner account, it all seemed to be working. On top of this, I then chose to create a custom CNAME entry in my domains DNS Records so that I could use:</p>

<blockquote>  
> 
> feeds.gep13.co.uk
> 
> </blockquote>


<p>rather then</p>

<blockquote>  
> 
> feeds.feedburner.com
> 
> </blockquote>


<p>This is very small change, but it helps to keep everything “tidy”, and again, it was very simple to setup and configure.</p>

<p>If you actually subscribe to my blog, there should be nothing for you to do, everything should continue to work as it did before. The redirect to the FeedBurner proxy happens with the help of the WordPress plugin I am using. If you have any problems, and for some reason the RSS Feed is no longer working, then I would be interested to hear from you so that I can figure out what is going on. Thanks!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Back in October of 2011, I dropped an email to Matt Lacey, of the <a href="http://wpug.net/">Windows Phone User Group</a>, asking whether he would be interested in doing a talk up in Scotland at the <a href="http://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/">Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group</a>.  This was a bit of a long shot, but I was always brought up with the saying, “If you don’t ask, you don’t get”, so I thought the worst that he could say would be “No”.</p>

<p>I am thrilled to say that Matt agreed that coming up to Aberdeen would certainly be a possibility, and in fact, he would be interested in doing a tour of the user groups up in Scotland.  Once again, with the help of the <a href="http://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/post/2011/12/10/Scottish-Meetup-Network.aspx">Scottish Meetup Network</a>, I am delighted to say that we have been able to secure Matt to do 3 User Group Sessions.</p>

<p>The schedule for the tour breaks down as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Tuesday 21 February</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.edinburgh.bcs.org/events/2011-12/120221.htm">What and why every developer needs to know about mobile development - BCS Edinburgh and Scottish Developers</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Wednesday 22nd February</strong></p>

<ul>

</ul>


<p>This is a very busy schedule, and hopefully you will be able to catch Matt at one of the above events.  I will update the above with links to full details of all the above events as and when they become available.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>As part of my work goals, I have been compiling a list of UK Developer Conferences/Events that are happening this year, and trying to decide which, if any, I can attend.  Note, I am not saying that this is a complete list of events.  In fact, this is just the opposite.  This is a list of events that I am aware of, and I would like to know about any that I have not listed here, see note at the end of the blog post.  I have not included any Local User Group Events in this list, as that would make for a very long list.  This list is limited to upcoming conferences which are between 1 and 5 days in duration.  If you are interested in finding Local User Group Events, you might want to check out this <a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/page/Scottish-Meetings.aspx">calendar</a> which posts a number of upcoming events.</p>

<p>Once I know exact details for these events, in terms of exact dates, venues, websites, registration, etc, I will be updating this post.  More for the sake of my own sanity, so I don’t have to go digging around to find it again, but hopefully it will prove useful for you as well.  The events appear in “roughly” a chronological order, based on what I do know, but this will likely change around as the dates get confirmed.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Microsoft Tech Days</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Details can be found <a href="http://uktechdays.cloudapp.net/upcoming-events.aspx">here</a></p></li>
<li><p>You can also follow <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/uktechdays">@uktechdays</a> for more information</p></li>
<li><p>There is little point replicating all the events in this list, but it is a list that you should keep your eye on. Some great events in February for Windows Azure and Windows Phone 7</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>QCon London</strong>– 5th to 6th March 2012, The Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre, London</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Details of this event can be found <a href="http://qconlondon.com/">here</a></p></li>
<li><p>You can also follow <a href="https://twitter.com/#%21/QConLondon">@qconlondon</a> for more information</p></li>
<li><p>I have never attended this event before, but looking at the line-up, looks like a great event</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>DDD Reading - </strong>Don’t yet know exact date or venue</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/wordpress-3-3-1-released/" itemprop="url">WordPress 3.3.1 Released</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Having logged into my Blog this morning, I was informed that a new release of WordPress was available; Version 3.3.1.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2012-01-04_0644.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2012-01-04_0644_thumb.png" alt="2012-01-04_0644" /></a></p>

<p>Upon checking what was included in this <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2012/01/wordpress-3-3-1/">release</a>, it was clear that this was something that I should get installed pretty much straight away, and this is exactly what I did.</p>

<p>With the Database and Files backed up, I hit the Update button, and once again I am happy to say that everything “just worked”. It is good to see that the WordPress Developers are adding a “bit of fun” into the update process:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2012-01-04_0652.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2012-01-04_0652_thumb.png" alt="2012-01-04_0652" /></a></p>

<p>Since this update addresses a Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability, I would highly recommend that everyone using WordPress update their sites immediately.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>2011 was my first year of doing what I would class as “proper” blogging.  I have had a blog for several years now, but it is only recently, with my increased involvement in the community, that I have been doing more blog posts.  I have every intention of continuing this in 2012, and with that in mind, I wanted to capture the stats for my blog in 2011, so that I can compare them next year.</p>

<p>Here are my Google Analytics results:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/image.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/image_thumb.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>Highlights being:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>4,482 Visits</p></li>
<li><p>3,018 Unique Visitors</p></li>
<li><p>7,201 Pageviews</p></li>
<li><p>1.61 Pages/Visit</p></li>
<li><p>00:01:49 Avg. Time on Site</p></li>
<li><p>75.46% Bounce Rate</p></li>
<li><p>66.87% % New Visits</p></li>
</ul>


<p>And thanks to the JetPack addin that I use for my WordPress blog, other stats are:</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>It seems like everyone is doing a retrospective blog post about 2011, so I thought that I would jump on the bandwagon.</p>

<p>Here goes…</p>

<p>2011 has been a very busy year for me, both from a work/community and personal standpoint.  What follows is a brief recap of what I have been involved in this year, and also a look ahead at what I hope to be doing in 2012.</p>

<h2>Getting Involved in the Development Community</h2>

<p>Getting involved in the development community was one of my main aims for 2011, and I like to think that I have achieved this.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/">Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group</a> is going from strength to strength, both in terms of the number of registered members, as well as attendance.  With the help of our amazing vendor sponsors, we are able to offer the <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=107">following prizes</a> at each ADNUGUK meeting, and I am hopeful that this will continue into the New Year.  I am already looking to 2012 to get events planned and booked, and I am in a position where the next three events are in the planning stages, and although I can’t say too much yet, there is a HUGE event in the making for our 2 year anniversary in July.  More details will follow on this when I have some more pieces confirmed.</p>

<p>I went out of my way to attend numerous Community Events this year.  Looking at my <a href="http://tweetstats.com/graphs/gep13#tcloud">hashtag cloud</a> from Twitter, it is pretty clear where I went:</p>

<p><a href="http://tweetstats.com/graphs/gep13#tcloud"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image8.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>This year I attended, <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=28">DDD9</a>, <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=210">DDD Scotland</a>, <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=278">DDD South West</a>, <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=377">The Progressive .Net Tutorials</a>, <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=416">GiveCamp UK</a>, and <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=436">DunDDD</a>!  These were all great events, and if I was forced to choose one above all others, it would have to be GiveCamp UK.  The sense of satisfaction that everyone in attendance got from helping out at GiveCamp was amazing, and I would strongly encourage anyone to attend should it happen again in 2012.</p>

<p>Attending events like this is a great way to develop yourself as well as get to know other developers.  As a direct result of these events you can see from this graph the type of characters I have ended up talking to on Twitter throughout 2011:</p>

<p><a href="http://tweetstats.com/graphs/gep13#tcloud"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image9.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>All of the above mentioned people have helped me in 2011, in one way or another, and for this I am very grateful!  Twitter really is a great way to get involved with fellow developers, and it is a wonderful source of information.  If you are a developer, and you are not on Twitter, you should be!</p>

<p>As some of you may know, I am a Moderator of the ASP.Net Forum over at <a href="http://www.vbforums.com/index.php">VBForums</a> (and no, before Paul Stack or Barry Mooring say anything, this isn’t just a forum for Visual Basic), however this year saw me getting a <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=80">promotion to Super Moderator</a>.  As a result, I now have administration rights to all the forums, and am able to help out with moderating and moving threads around, and generally keeping the community there in check.</p>

<p>This year saw me review a couple of articles for the <a href="http://www.developerfusion.com/">developerFusion</a> website, something which I found to be very interesting, and which I hope to continue into 2012.</p>

<h2>From a Personal Stand Point</h2>

<p>I had the pleasure of entering my first <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=30">photography contest</a>, and although I didn’t win anything, it was a lot of fun.  The photos that did win were very <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=94">worthy winners</a>!  I like to “think” that I know how to take photos, but I really don’t.  However, I got a great birthday present this year which was a half day photography lesson, which I am really looking forward to in February next year, and I hope to pick up a few tips.</p>

<p>I did my first “proper” <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=193">User Group presentation</a>.  Going into next year, I am hoping to extend this to some of the larger User Group Events, however, I will have to do a lot of prep work for this, and also extend the areas that I am able to talk on, all of which will take a lot of time and effort, but the rewards should more than make up for this!</p>

<p>I went on an amazing <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=290">4x4 driving experience</a>, which I would thoroughly recommend to anyone!</p>

<p>I installed far too many <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=3">Visual Studio Extensions</a>!  Thankfully, <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=307">ExtensionSync</a> makes it very easy to maintain this across your different computers.</p>

<p>I set up the ability to <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=337">stream High Definition media to our upstairs television</a>.  This ended up being a lot more work than I thought it was going to be, but I am happy to say that the end result works really well!</p>

<p>My inner child was awoken with the purchase of <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=495">LEGO Mindstorms</a>.  If you are looking for the ultimate geek toy, look no further, it is truly amazing!</p>

<p>My wife and I celebrated our first Wedding Anniversary!  If she can continue to put up with me, this will hopefully be the first of many happy years together.</p>

<h2>Looking forward to 2012</h2>

<p>Looking forward into 2012, there will mainly be more of the same as above.  Following <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=313">the principles</a> that I took from Mark Rendle’s talk at DDD South West I will be looking to improve myself as a developer, but I also hope to break into doing talks at some of these community events, rather than simply attending them.  This will be a big step for me, but something that I am very much looking forward to.</p>

<p>I will be continuing to blog next year as well, however, I am looking to writing much more technical blog posts.  I have learnt a lot this year from all the talks that I have attended, and I am looking to implement these technologies in a number of pet projects.  I will be blogging the trials and tribulations that I have along the way, which will hopefully help other people.</p>

<p>And that, as they say, is that!  I hope you all had a great 2011, and here’s to 2012!</p>
