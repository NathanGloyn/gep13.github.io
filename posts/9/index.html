	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/update-7-10-8107-79-for-windows-phone-7-wp7/" itemprop="url">Update 7.10.8107.79 for Windows Phone 7 (#WP7)</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Today I saw some tweets on Twitter hinting at the fact that a new update was available for Windows Phone, so when I got home tonight I plugged my HTC HD7 phone into my laptop, and sure enough, there was an update available!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/1._Update_Available.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/1._Update_Available_thumb.png" alt="1._Update_Available" /></a></p>

<p>Clicking on update presented me with more information about this update:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2._Update_Your_Phone.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2._Update_Your_Phone_thumb.png" alt="2._Update_Your_Phone" /></a></p>

<p>In case it is not clear from the picture this update includes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Fixes an on-screen keyboard issue to prevent the keyboard from disappearing during typing.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixes a Gmail syncing issue.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixes a location access issue. With this fix, the Me feature in the People Hub sends anonymous information about nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers to Microsoft only if you agree to allow the Check In function to access and use location information.</p></li>
<li><p>Revokes digital certificates from DigiCert Sdn Bhd to address an encryption issue.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixes an email issue related to Microsoft Exchange Server 2003. With this fix, when you reply to or forward a message, the original message is now included in your response.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixes a voicemail notification issue.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>For full information about this update, be sure to check out the site <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/howto/wp7/basics/update-history.aspx">here</a>.</p>

<p>After doing a quick check that everything was ready to go, I opted to start the update. Thankfully, the installer reminded me of this important fact:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/3._Plug_in_computer.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/3._Plug_in_computer_thumb.png" alt="3._Plug_in_computer" /></a></p>

<p>10 steps and 30 minutes later, I had a newly updated phone (the majority of this time was spent backing up the phone before applying the update).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/5._Success.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/5._Success_thumb.png" alt="5._Success" /></a></p>

<p>With this update in place, I am happy to report that I am now able to connect to my wireless internet connection in the house. I was previously having issues with this following the last update.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>With reference to my <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=571">list of events here</a>, I am happy to say that today I finished getting everything booked for attending the UK Tech Days, in London in February.</p>

<p>Microsoft are putting on two events:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://uktechdays.cloudapp.net/upcoming-events/windows-azure-bootcamp-(london">Windows Azure Bootcamp – 3rd February 2012</a>.aspx)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://uktechdays.cloudapp.net/upcoming-events/windows-phone-camp-(london">Windows Phone Camp – 4th February 2012</a>.aspx)</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>NOTE: If you can’t make the London events, the events are being repeated in Bristol the following week. Information <a href="http://uktechdays.cloudapp.net/upcoming-events/windows-azure-bootcamp-(bristol">here</a>.aspx) and <a href="http://uktechdays.cloudapp.net/upcoming-events/windows-phone-camp-(bristol">here</a>.aspx).</strong></p>

<p>Now that the hassle of getting the flights etc. booked has passed, I am very much looking forward to both of these events!</p>

<p>With the exception of a review that I did for a devFusion article, which made use of Windows Azure, I haven’t done anything with it. I am very interested to learn <em>exactly </em>what it is, how and where it can be used, and also how easily it can be integrated into existing applications. For instance, I recently saw this new <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/windows-azure-storage/">WordPress plugin</a> from Microsoft. This type of integration is very interesting, and I am curious to see how this could work elsewhere.</p>

<p>I have been “dabbling” with Windows Phone 7 for a while now, but I haven’t given it the attention that it needs to learn it properly, and I am hoping that the Windows Phone Bootcamp will be the kick-start that is required. After all, I have the developer account ready and waiting, just no applications to push onto the Marketplace. In addition, I will also get the opportunity to finally meet Pete Vickers (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/petevick">@petevick</a>) from <a href="http://appamundi.com/">AppaMundi</a> in person. I have “known” Pete for a while now as he hangs out on the Mobile Development Forums over at <a href="http://www.vbforums.com/forumdisplay.php?f=70">VBForums</a>, and it will be great to catch up at the event.</p>

<p>If you are thinking about attending these events I would strongly encourage you to get registered as soon as possible as some of them have gone to the waiting list stage and you may miss out.</p>

<p>If you are not able to make it, keep an eye on this blog as I intend to do posts over the course of the weekend, so hopefully I can keep you up to date with what I learn while I am there.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>As most of you will know, I have been a long time fan of the author Stuart MacBride. As shown <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=725">here</a>, <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=727">here</a> and <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=399">here</a>.</p>

<p>After I got the new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0007344171/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0007344171">Birthdays for the Dead</a>, delivered, I found out that Stuart was going to be doing a book signing at the local WHSmith in Aberdeen. Book in hand, I decided that I would go along to the book signing. (I have to admit that I checked first in order to make sure that bringing a book that I had already purchased into the book store, but I was told that this would be ok, but I took the receipt just to be on the safe side <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/wlEmoticon-smile3.png" alt="Smile" />). Although not ideal for me, I am happy to report that the queue for getting the book signed was massive. I knew that Stuart was a popular author in the North East, but to get such a turn out was great to see. Congratulations!</p>

<p>With some time to kill while I was in the queue, I started to read the book, and I have to say, so far so good <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/wlEmoticon-smile3.png" alt="Smile" />. I will keep you posted on how it goes.</p>

<p>For those interested, here is the result of waiting in the queue:</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/continue-using-wordpress-or-not/" itemprop="url">Continue Using WordPress, or Not?</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>In one way or another, I have had a blog since the start of 2008. This started out as a custom blog with I created in ASP.Net. This was hosted on my own server in the house, using Red Hat Linux, MySQL and Mono (using the mod_mono Apache Module). This was set up as more of an experiment than anything, just to prove that you could happily run an ASP.Net application on top of Linux, and by the start of 2009 I wasn’t really using the blog anymore. Back in May 2011, I decided that I wanted to start blogging “properly” again. This decision was taken for a number of reasons, but mainly due to the fact that I had started getting more involved in the UK .Net Development Community and I wanted somewhere to record what was going on, and so this WordPress blog was born.</p>

<p>Being a .Net Developer, my intention was always to start using one of the .Net Blogging systems such as <a href="http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/">BlogEngine</a>, <a href="http://dasblog.info/">dasBlog</a>, or <a href="http://subtextproject.com/default.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1">Subtext</a>, however, due to time constraints at the time, I set up this WordPress blog. This was ridiculously simple to do, and I was very quickly able to set up the blog as I wanted it, with pages, contact form, and blog entries. There was very little that I could fault with WordPress. The sheer volume of plugins that it has means that if you want to add something to your blog, such as Galleries, Comment Management, Syntax Highlighting, you can simply add it. And, best of all, normally, this doesn’t cost you anything.</p>

<p>For the next year or so, I was quite happy using the WordPress system, and it wasn’t until I set up the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group site with <a href="http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/">BlogEngine</a>, that I started to wonder whether I wanted to move this blog onto another system. I started doing some investigation, and there are a number of tutorials out there that show you the steps that you need to take in order to migrate a WordPress blog onto another system. The more I thought about it, the more I thought that I was going to go ahead and move it. At least that way, if there was “something” that I wanted to add to the blog system, be it another module, or function, then in theory (given that I am a .Net Developer and that a new system would be based on .Net) I should quite easily be able to add it.</p>

<p>However, recently, a number of things have happened that are making me to rethink this decision.</p>

<ol>
<li><p> I attended <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=569">GiveCamp UK</a> and worked on a WordPress site and I got to see more into the innards of WordPress and saw that it isn’t that “bad” to tinker with, as I had previously thought</p></li>
<li><p> I found an amazing Metro WordPress Theme thanks to <a href="http://www.pedrolamas.com/2011/12/21/metro-cimbalino-wordpress-theme/">Pedro Lamas</a></p></li>
<li><p> <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=416">WordPress 3.3.1</a> was released and it is quite simply, amazing!</p></li>
<li><p> I installed a few new WordPress Plugins that contained the last remaining functionality that I was looking for on my blog, namely <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/backupwordpress/">BackUpWordPress</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/disqus-comment-system/">Disqus Comment System</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/feedburner-setting/">FeedBurner FeedSmith Extend</a>, <a href="http://alexrabe.de/wordpress-plugins/nextgen-gallery/">NextGen Gallery</a>, and <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/now-reading-reloaded/">Now Reading Reloaded</a>, (If you are interested in seeing all the WordPress plugins that I currently use, take a look at this <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=174">blog post</a>).</p></li>
</ol>


<p>The Now Reading plugin doesn’t “quite” do exactly what I want, but I think I am now prepared to invest the time to get it working the way I want it.</p>

<p>So what does all this mean?</p>

<p>Unless someone can convince me to the contrary, I am going to continue using WordPress.</p>

<p>It is VERY good at what it does, and I don’t see any killer feature in any of the other systems that would make me want to switch. Granted, it is created in PHP, and this is not something that I am overly familiar with, but using it also forces me to get my toes wet with PHP, which when it comes to becoming a “well-rounded” developer is far from a bad thing. To this end, over the last week or so I have added a few more things to the blog. This includes, as mentioned, the Now Reading plugin which you can see in action <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?now_reading_library=true">here</a> (expect to see some changes to this in the near future), and I have added some photo albums, which you can see <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?page_id=581">here</a>. The majority of these photos come from my old blog back in 2008 (I have also imported the old blog posts from that blog into this one). If anyone is looking for an explanation of what the hell “<strong>Gary The Coconut</strong>” is all about, check out this blog post <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=698">here</a> and <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=694">here</a>.</p>

<p>As always, I would be interested to hear your thoughts on this, so feel free to comment.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I have decided to start using <a href="http://feedburner.google.com/">FeedBurner</a> for managing the Feeds for my blog (If you are not familiar with what FeedBurner is, you can find some more information <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FeedBurner">here</a>). Basically, it will allow me, on top of the Google Analytics that I already have running, to monitor how many people (if any) are actually looking at my blog.</p>

<p>The installation and setup of FeedBurner actually turned out to be quite simple. The one thing that I was worried about was previously subscribed RSS readers not working after the switch. However, with the help of the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/feedburner-setting/">FeedBurner FeedSmith Extend</a> plugin for WordPress, this is all taken care of (and it is actually recommended by FeedBurner during the setup phase. With that in place, and the feeds configured in my FeedBurner account, it all seemed to be working. On top of this, I then chose to create a custom CNAME entry in my domains DNS Records so that I could use:</p>

<blockquote>  
> 
> feeds.gep13.co.uk
> 
> </blockquote>


<p>rather then</p>

<blockquote>  
> 
> feeds.feedburner.com
> 
> </blockquote>


<p>This is very small change, but it helps to keep everything “tidy”, and again, it was very simple to setup and configure.</p>

<p>If you actually subscribe to my blog, there should be nothing for you to do, everything should continue to work as it did before. The redirect to the FeedBurner proxy happens with the help of the WordPress plugin I am using. If you have any problems, and for some reason the RSS Feed is no longer working, then I would be interested to hear from you so that I can figure out what is going on. Thanks!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Back in October of 2011, I dropped an email to Matt Lacey, of the <a href="http://wpug.net/">Windows Phone User Group</a>, asking whether he would be interested in doing a talk up in Scotland at the <a href="http://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/">Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group</a>.  This was a bit of a long shot, but I was always brought up with the saying, “If you don’t ask, you don’t get”, so I thought the worst that he could say would be “No”.</p>

<p>I am thrilled to say that Matt agreed that coming up to Aberdeen would certainly be a possibility, and in fact, he would be interested in doing a tour of the user groups up in Scotland.  Once again, with the help of the <a href="http://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/post/2011/12/10/Scottish-Meetup-Network.aspx">Scottish Meetup Network</a>, I am delighted to say that we have been able to secure Matt to do 3 User Group Sessions.</p>

<p>The schedule for the tour breaks down as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Tuesday 21 February</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.edinburgh.bcs.org/events/2011-12/120221.htm">What and why every developer needs to know about mobile development - BCS Edinburgh and Scottish Developers</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Wednesday 22nd February</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://dwsmattlacey.eventbrite.com/">What and why every developer needs to know about mobile development - Dundee Web Standards</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Thursday 23rd February</strong></p>

<li><a href="http://adnuguk-feb2012.eventbrite.com/?ref=ebtn">Getting started with Windows Phone – Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>This is a very busy schedule, and hopefully you will be able to catch Matt at one of the above events.  I will update the above with links to full details of all the above events as and when they become available.</p>

<p>If you require any additional information about the above tour, please feel free to get in touch.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>As part of my work goals, I have been compiling a list of UK Developer Conferences/Events that are happening this year, and trying to decide which, if any, I can attend.  Note, I am not saying that this is a complete list of events.  In fact, this is just the opposite.  This is a list of events that I am aware of, and I would like to know about any that I have not listed here, see note at the end of the blog post.  I have not included any Local User Group Events in this list, as that would make for a very long list.  This list is limited to upcoming conferences which are between 1 and 5 days in duration.  If you are interested in finding Local User Group Events, you might want to check out this <a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/page/Scottish-Meetings.aspx">calendar</a> which posts a number of upcoming events.</p>

<p>Once I know exact details for these events, in terms of exact dates, venues, websites, registration, etc, I will be updating this post.  More for the sake of my own sanity, so I don’t have to go digging around to find it again, but hopefully it will prove useful for you as well.  The events appear in “roughly” a chronological order, based on what I do know, but this will likely change around as the dates get confirmed.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Having logged into my Blog this morning, I was informed that a new release of WordPress was available; Version 3.3.1.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2012-01-04_0644.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2012-01-04_0644_thumb.png" alt="2012-01-04_0644" /></a></p>

<p>Upon checking what was included in this <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2012/01/wordpress-3-3-1/">release</a>, it was clear that this was something that I should get installed pretty much straight away, and this is exactly what I did.</p>

<p>With the Database and Files backed up, I hit the Update button, and once again I am happy to say that everything “just worked”. It is good to see that the WordPress Developers are adding a “bit of fun” into the update process:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2012-01-04_0652.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2012-01-04_0652_thumb.png" alt="2012-01-04_0652" /></a></p>

<p>Since this update addresses a Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability, I would highly recommend that everyone using WordPress update their sites immediately.</p>
