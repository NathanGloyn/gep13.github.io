	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Hot on the heels of the <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/windows-azure-bootcamp-uk-tech-days/">Windows Azure Bootcamp</a> that I did this weekend, I decided that I wanted to do <em>something</em> with Windows Azure, that way I could practice what I had learnt, and begin to increase my exposure to what Windows Azure brings to the table. I decided that I wanted to use the Windows Azure Blob Storage to host all of the static content of my WordPress Blog, thus, <em>hopefully, </em>increasing the performance of my blog. What follows is a list of instructions for setting up your WordPress Blog, as well as your Windows Azure account, and also your domain registrar (in order to apply a shortened domain name to your Blob Storage Account).</p>

<p>This article breaks down into three main parts:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Set up your Blob Storage Account in the Windows Azure Portal, along with DNS settings for your Domain Registrar</p></li>
<li><p> Configure your Blob Storage Account using CloudXplorer</p></li>
<li><p> Set up a WordPress plugin to communicate with your Blob Storage Account</p></li>
</ol>


<p>So, let&rsquo;s get started!</p>

<h1>Setting up Windows Azure</h1>

<ol>
<li><p> The first thing that you are going to need is a Windows Azure Account. If you don’t already have one, there are a couple of ways that you can get one:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/">Windows Azure 3 Month Free Trial</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits/">MSDN Subscribers can get Free Benefits</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/">A number of different paid subscriptions</a></p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p> Once you have logged into your Windows Azure account, you will be presented with a huge selection of options, the scope of which are far out with the intention of this blog post, as a result, only the specific options to enable Blob Storage will be discussed here. Using the picture to the below as a guide, first select <em>Hosted Services, Storage Accounts &amp; CDN, Storage Accounts, </em>then <em>New Storage Account.</em><br/>
<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Create_New_Storage_Account.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Create_New_Storage_Account_thumb.png" alt="Create_New_Storage_Account" /></a></p></li>
<li><p> This will open the <em>Create a New Storage Account_dialog, where you will need to provide the details for the Storage Account that you would like to create.
<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Create_a_Storage_Account.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Create_a_Storage_Account_thumb.png" alt="Create_a_Storage_Account" /></a>The first of which is the URL that you would like to use. This needs to be unique across the entire Windows Azure infrastructure so you may need to get a little creative with your choice of name. You will be prompted with an error message if you enter something that isn’t allowed.<br/>
<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Error_-_dont_use_capitals.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Error_-_dont_use_capitals_thumb.png" alt="Error_-_don't_use_capitals" /></a>
The next piece of information is the </em>region or affinity group_ that you want your Blob Storage Account to be located. Microsoft has several Data Centers located across the world, including Anywhere US, South Central US, Anywhere Europe, West Europe, Anywhere Asia, Southeast Asia, East Asia, North Central US, North Europe. Simply pick the region that makes most sense to your location.
Click OK.</p></li>
<li><p> Your Storage Account will now get created. There will be a slight delay as your Account is first “Creating…”<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Storage_Account_Creating.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Storage_Account_Creating_thumb.png" alt="Storage_Account_Creating" /></a>Then “Resolving DNS…”<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Storage_Account_Resolving_DNS.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Storage_Account_Resolving_DNS_thumb.png" alt="Storage_Account_Resolving_DNS" /></a>But the end result will be your Storage Account will be “Created”<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Storage_Account_Created.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Storage_Account_Created_thumb.png" alt="Storage_Account_Created" /></a></p></li>
<li><p> If you select your new Storage Account, on the right hand side of the Windows Azure Portal you will see all of the properties for this new Storage Account:<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Storage_Account_Properties.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Storage_Account_Properties_thumb.png" alt="Storage_Account_Properties" />
</a>The main ones of interest are the “Keys”, which we will use later to connect to the Blob Storage Account from WordPress, and the Blob URL. The Blob URL is the publicly routable URL for accessing your Blob Storage account. Any files you upload to the Blob Storage Account will be accessible using this URL as a prefix. As you can see though, this URL is slightly long, and when used in the context of existing website, say gep13.co.uk, it bears no relation to it. However, this is something we can change by applying a Custom Domain to the Storage Account.</p></li>
<li><p> Select your Storage Account, and then press <em>Add Domain</em>, as shown below:<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Add_Custom_Domain.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Add_Custom_Domain_thumb.png" alt="Add_Custom_Domain" /></a></p></li>
<li><p> In the <em>Add a Custom Domain </em>Dialog, enter the domain name that you would like to use for this Storage Account. In my case, I wanted to use cdn.gep13.co.uk:<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Add_Custom_Domain_Name.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Add_Custom_Domain_Name_thumb.png" alt="Add_Custom_Domain_Name" /></a>Press OK.</p></li>
<li><p> At this point, Windows Azure will begin to create the Custom Domain name:<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Custom_Domain_Name_being_created.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Custom_Domain_Name_being_created_thumb.png" alt="Custom_Domain_Name_being_created" /></a></p></li>
<li><p> Once the initial process for the Custom Domain creation has completed, you will then have to validate that the domain name that you want to use actually belongs to you:<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Validate_Custom_Domain_Name.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Validate_Custom_Domain_Name_thumb.png" alt="Validate_Custom_Domain_Name" /></a>In order to do this, you will need to log into your Domain Registrar and alter the DNS Records for your domain to include a new CNAME record. The details for this record are provided for you, as per the above screenshot, so simply enter these details into your Domain Registrar site. As an example, this is what I had to do:<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Add_Verify_Domain_to_Registrar.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Add_Verify_Domain_to_Registrar_thumb.png" alt="Add_Verify_Domain_to_Registrar" /></a>Depending on how your Domain Registrar user interface works, remember to include the “.” at the end of the Canonical name, otherwise the DNS Record will not be accepted. Your new DNS record will take a while to propagate across the internet, so in the meantime, simply close the above <em>Validate Custom Domain</em> window, and you will see that your Custom Domain creation is in a <em>Pending </em>state:<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Custom_Domain_Name_Pending.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Custom_Domain_Name_Pending_thumb.png" alt="Custom_Domain_Name_Pending" /></a></p></li>
</ol>


<p>At this point, you might want to jump to Step 11.</p>

<ol>
<li>. Once enough time has passed (I waited a couple of hours) return to the Windows Azure portal and select your domain and click Validate Domain:<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Validate_Custom_Domain_Name_001.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Validate_Custom_Domain_Name_001_thumb.png" alt="Validate_Custom_Domain_Name_001" /></a>If everything worked correctly you will see:<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Domain_validated.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Domain_validated_thumb.png" alt="Domain_validated" /></a>However, depending on how long you waited, you might see this:<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Validation_Failed.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Validation_Failed_thumb.png" alt="Validation_Failed" /></a></li>
</ol>


<p>If you do, don’t worry, this simply means that the DNS Settings haven’t finished propagating, so try again later.</p>

<ol>
<li>. The only other thing left to do on this side of things is to create another CNAME record which will do the work of redirecting any requests to your Custom Domain, to your Blob Storage Account. All this means is that you need a CNAME record that has something like the following:<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/CNAME_for_redirect.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/CNAME_for_redirect_thumb.png" alt="CNAME_for_redirect" /></a>This is a redirect from the Custom Domain Name that you created, to the Blob URL for your storage account that was highlighted in Step 5 above. In order to say time, you might want to think about creating this CNAME record at the same time as you create the verify CNAME, that way you won’t have to wait a second lot of propagation time.</li>
</ol>


<h1></h1>

<h1>configure your Blob Storage Account</h1>

<ol>
<li><p> Now that the Blob Storage Account has been created, and Custom Domain established, we have a little bit of work to do in order to first configure the Blob Storage Account for use. It is easiest to do this using a 3rd Party Tool. There are a couple of main ones out there, the first being from <a href="http://cerebrata.com/">Redgate</a> (who acquired Cerebrata) and you can get a trial version of their software, and also <a href="http://clumsyleaf.com/products/cloudxplorer">CloudXplorer from ClumsyLeaf</a>. For the purposes of this walk through, I will be using CloudXplorer, so go ahead and get that installed.</p></li>
<li><p> Open CloudXplorer and select File | Accounts and the _Manage accounts_window opens:<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Manage_Accounts.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Manage_Accounts_thumb.png" alt="Manage_Accounts" /></a></p></li>
<li><p> Click the New… button and then select Windows Azure Account… and the <em>Windows Azure account </em>window will open:<br/>
<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/New_Windows_Azure_Account.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/New_Windows_Azure_Account_thumb.png" alt="New_Windows_Azure_Account" /></a></p></li>
<li><p> Using the information from step 5 above, enter the details of the Blob Storage Account that we created, where “Secret Key:” equates to the “Primary Access Key” (simply click View button to bring this up) and Name: is the Name of your Blob Storage Account, i.e. in my case gep13wpstorage.
<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Windows_Azure_Account_Window.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Windows_Azure_Account_Window_thumb.png" alt="Windows_Azure_Account_Window" /></a></p></li>
<li><p> With the account in place, the first thing we need to do is to create a container within the Blob Storage Account. This will let us compartmentalise files into the correct location. Right click in the right hand window of CloudXplorer and select New | Container…<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/CloudXplorer_Create_Container.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/CloudXplorer_Create_Container_thumb.png" alt="CloudXplorer_Create_Container" /></a></p></li>
<li><p> In the <em>Create directory/container </em>window, enter the name for your container. I went for “myuploads”.
<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Create_New_Container.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Create_New_Container_thumb.png" alt="Create_New_Container" /></a></p></li>
<li><p> Now we need to set the properties of the container to allow public access. Right click on the container that you just created and select Properties.<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Container_Properties.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Container_Properties_thumb.png" alt="Container_Properties" /></a></p></li>
<li><p> In the myloads Properties window, select the Policies tab and then select &ldquo;<em>Full public read access</em>” in the Access control drop down list, then select ok.<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Container_Policies.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Container_Policies_thumb.png" alt="Container_Policies" /></a></p></li>
</ol>


<h1>configure WordPress</h1>

<p>At this point, you have a number of options to set up your WordPress site to use Windows Azure as it’s repository for static content. Microsoft have actually released their own WordPress plugin which does just that. If you are interested, you can find this <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/windows-azure-storage/">here</a>. I ended up not using this particular plugin. As far as I could see, the onus was on you to manually move the files into your Azure container. Now, this isn’t hard to do, using the CloudXplorer I showed earlier, files can easily be copied into the container, but I wanted something a little more integrated.</p>

<p>I ended up using the excellent W3 Total Cache plugin which you can find <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/w3-total-cache/">here</a>. Again, the complete setup and configuration of this plugin is out with the scope of this particular blog post (I might write another one on this), however, the main thing to know is that there are a number of potential endpoints for this plugin including:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/W3TC_CDN_Options.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/W3TC_CDN_Options_thumb.png" alt="W3TC_CDN_Options" /></a></p>

<p>As you will see, I have chosen Microsoft Azure Storage. From there, you can then specify the options for connecting to Windows Azure:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/CDN_Settings.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/CDN_Settings_thumb.png" alt="CDN_Settings" /></a></p>

<p>Including the Custom Domain name which we set up earlier (if you can remember that far back).</p>

<p>With that in place, you can then use the W3 Total Cache plugin to move all the necessary files into your Blob Storage Account. You can simply click on each of the required buttons:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/General_Settings.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/General_Settings_thumb.png" alt="General_Settings" /></a></p>

<p>Then, with all the files uploaded, and W3 Total Cache activated, it will rewrite all of the URL’s for all of your static content to come from your Blob Storage Account. Feel free to take a look and see this in action by right clicking on the view source of this page, and searching for cdn.gep13.co.uk.</p>

<p>And that, as they say, is that! If you have any questions, please feel free to get in touch.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/windows-phone-7-bootcamp-uk-tech-days/" itemprop="url">Windows Phone 7 Bootcamp, UK Tech Days</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Today, I attended the Windows Phone 7 Bootcamp, which was organised by Microsoft and <a href="http://uktechdays.cloudapp.net/home.aspx">UK Tech Days</a>. The event was also being supported by the Windows Phone MVP’s from <a href="http://appamundi.com/">Appamundi</a>.  You can find details of this event <a href="http://uktechdays.cloudapp.net/upcoming-events/windows-phone-camp-(london">here</a>.aspx).  This was hot on the heels of the Windows Azure Bootcamp which I <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/windows-azure-bootcamp-uk-tech-days/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=windows-azure-bootcamp-uk-tech-days">attended yesterday</a>.  The event broke down as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A series of sessions covering:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Design Session: User Journey</p></li>
<li><p>Intro to Windows Phone Dev</p></li>
<li><p>Controls &amp; Control Toolkit</p></li>
<li><p>Execution Model</p></li>
<li><p>Storing Data</p></li>
<li><p>Launchers and hookers</p></li>
<li><p>Background Tasks</p></li>
<li><p>Marketplace &amp; Submissions</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>A series of Hands On Labs</p></li>
</ul>


<p>In a change to the “normal” format of these events, each of the sessions were voluntary.  The idea was that you could dip in and out of the sessions, and carry on with “Hands on Labs”, or ask questions of the volunteer helpers, or socialize with the other attendees.  I have to say that I wasn’t prepared for this format, I was instead expecting a similar format to the Bootcamp yesterday (i.e. a more rigid structure), but I have to say, that it worked.</p>

<p>I think that this was helped by the fact that the venue was set up to encourage interaction.  There were loads of open spaces to talk to delegates, a table tennis table, multiple table football tables, a pool table, and comfortable seats.  The only thing that I would say is, when you were in the auditorium trying to listen to the speaker, the sound of people playing table tennis was slightly off-putting, but that is a minor complaint.</p>

<p>I have to say a big shout out to <a href="http://www.thehitandrun.com/">hit+run</a>, you can find them on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/hnrcrew_europe">here</a>.  They were creating custom Windows Phone 7 t-shirts, which each attendee got for free.  There was a “huge” queue to get one, but the end result was very impressive, and worth the wait!  Thanks!</p>

<p>As per yesterday, I would thoroughly recommend that if you get a chance to attend a UK Tech Days event, you should definitely grab it.  For a list of upcoming events, you can check out this list <a href="http://uktechdays.cloudapp.net/upcoming-events.aspx">here</a>.</p>

<h1>Book recommendations</h1>

<p>Unfortunately, I forgot to ask the organisers and presenters for the Windows Phone 7 books that they recommend, however, here are some of the ones that I own and highly recommend:</p>

<h1>Looking ahead…</h1>

<p>I asked this question yesterday, with regard to Windows Azure, but what am I going to do, going forward, with Windows Phone?  The answer to this question is, a lot!  This is for a couple of reasons, not least because of the brand new, shiny, <a href="http://www.nokia.com/gb-en/products/phone/lumia800?sissr=1#">Nokia Lumia 800</a>, which I got while I attended this event!  Oh sorry, did I not mention that until just now <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/wlEmoticon-smile1.png" alt="Smile" />.  Yes, you heard me correct, I received a free <a href="http://www.nokia.com/gb-en/products/phone/lumia800?sissr=1#">Nokia Lumia 800</a>.  In attendance at the event were representatives of Nokia who are running a program where if you can prove that you intend to create and publish an app onto the Windows Phone Marketplace, they will give you a phone.  I have been toying with the idea of doing a couple of applications, and this is really the reason that I wanted to attend this Bootcamp, to give me the “kick” to get them done.  I knocked up a quick storyboard to indicate the intention of my first application, and with that in place, I put this to them, and they gave me a phone.  Huge thank you to Nokia!!!</p>

<p>So, if nothing else, I will be creating a Windows Phone 7 application in the next month.  However, I really feel that this platform has a lot going for it, and I definitely want to get more involved with it, and I am actually thinking about doing some talks on it in the near future.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/windows-azure-bootcamp-uk-tech-days/" itemprop="url">Windows Azure Bootcamp, UK Tech Days</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Today, I attended the Windows Azure Bootcamp, which was organised by Microsoft and <a href="http://uktechdays.cloudapp.net/home.aspx">UK Tech Days</a>.  You can find details of this event <a href="http://uktechdays.cloudapp.net/upcoming-events/windows-azure-bootcamp-(london">here</a>.aspx).  I was really looking forward to attending this event, as Windows Azure is something that I have been interested in getting into for a while.  I am happy to say that I was not disappointed, it really was a great event!  The event broke down as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>An overview of Windows Azure</p></li>
<li><p>Overview of Storage, Web, and Worker Role – followed by a hands on lab</p></li>
<li><p>Overview of SQL Azure – followed by a hands on lab</p></li>
<li><p>Overview of App Fab (now known as Service Bus and ACS) – followed by a hands on lab</p></li>
<li><p>Question and Answer session</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I was really impressed with the hands on labs, and the overall structure of the day.  The only thing that I would say is that at some points, the presenters did start to lose the audience, and there was a lot of chatter across the room.  This was rather distracting at times, and made it really difficult to hear and understand what they were trying to say.</p>

<p>With each lab, the sample application slowly built into a complete application, that utilised a Web Role, a Worker Role (using the queue), along with Blob Storage, and a SQL Azure Database.  There are some very complicated situations within Azure, and creating an application like this, meant that you could easily see how each piece fitted together.</p>

<p>I would highly recommend attending a UK Tech Days event to anyone, and if you are interested in other events that are coming up, I would suggest that you take a look <a href="http://uktechdays.cloudapp.net/upcoming-events.aspx">here</a>.  I am happy to say that I am attending another event tomorrow <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" />.</p>

<h1>Where to find Azure resources</h1>

<p>Following this Windows Azure event, it is clear that there is a growing number of resources for getting started with Windows Azure, and what follows is a list of the links that was provided on the day.  I will certainly be checking some of these out:</p>

<h1>Book Recommendations</h1>

<p>One of the last questions that I asked before leaving the venue was whether or not there were any recommended books for learning Windows Azure.  The responses from Steve Plank, Steve Spencer, Andy Cross, and Richard Conway were the following:</p>

<h1>Looking ahead…</h1>

<p>So, what happens next?  Now that I have had this introduction to Windows Azure, what am I going to do with it.  The short answer is, I am not sure <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" />.  I am very interested in looking into the VM Role within Windows Azure, and how I could make use of that, and having just set up my WordPress Blog to use the Amazon S3 system as a CDN, I think I am going to look into using Azure Storage for it instead.  I will post back if I end up using this.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/use-the-cloud9-online-ide-to-hack-on-wordpress/" itemprop="url">Use the Cloud9 Online IDE to Hack on WordPress</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>As some of you may know, I have been <em>hacking</em> on this WordPress blog site recently.  The decision to &ldquo;improve&rdquo; this site has really come from the realisation that WordPress is actually very good at what it does, and I am going to <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/continue-using-wordpress-or-not/">continue using it for the foreseeable future</a>.  With that in mind, there were a few things that were annoying me about the site, so I started digging around the innards of WordPress to figure out what could be changed, and more importantly, how to do it.  To start with, this was done using the always useful FTP application, <a href="http://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a>.  I would download a .php file locally, make some changes to it, and then upload it again.  This cycle repeated for a few iterations, until I realised that there <em>must</em> be a better way to do this!</p>

<h1>Using the WordPress Editor</h1>

<p>Now, WordPress comes with its own built-in file editor, which gives you the ability to edit individual files.  This can be pretty much any file within WordPress, be it, plugins, themes, script files, etc.  However, the editor itself is very basic, and I quickly became annoyed at using it:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/WordPress_Editor.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/WordPress_Editor_thumb.png" alt="WordPress_Editor" /></a></p>

<h1>Using an Online IDE</h1>

<p>Then I remembered about a conversation had with Phil Leggetter (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/leggetter">@leggetter</a>) and Daniel Elliot (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/agileguy">@agileguy</a>) while I was at <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/my-impressions-of-givecampuk/">GiveCamp UK</a> last year, and the idea of using an online IDE to do the work started to become more appealing.  This would mean that I could &ldquo;hack&rdquo; on the files directly from within the browser, but still get the added benefits, such as syntax highlighting.  A quick search, and it turns out that there are lots of online IDE&rsquo;s out there.  Here are some of the ones that I tried out:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://coderun.com/ide/">coderun</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://shiftedit.net/">ShiftEdit</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://codeanywhere.net/">codeanywhere</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://c9.io/">Cloud9 IDE</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>The requirements for what I wanted were quite simple:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Be free (yes, I am a cheap skate, but for now, what I need to use it for doesn&rsquo;t warrant paying for the service)</p></li>
<li><p> Allow editing of files on a FTP Server</p></li>
<li><p> Syntax Highlighting</p></li>
<li><p> Allow private projects</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Due to requirement 1 <a href="http://coderun.com/ide/">coderun</a> was not able to be used.  Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, this is a GREAT application, and if I was looking to code full-blown ASP.Net applications in the cloud, this would definitely be one of the go to applications.  That left three applications to whittle down.</p>

<p>Although it claims to be able to do it, I couldn&rsquo;t get <a href="https://codeanywhere.net/">codeanywhere</a> to connect to my FTP Server (and this wasn&rsquo;t for want of trying) so I gave up on using that.  That left <a href="http://shiftedit.net/">ShiftEdit</a> and <a href="http://c9.io/">Cloud9 IDE</a>.</p>

<p>I played with both of these, on and off, while I was doing my hacking, and I have to say that they are both very good.  Both are free (depending on what you want to do with them), and I found it hard to choose between them.  After a good bit of consideration, I have decided to continue using <a href="http://c9.io/">Cloud9 IDE</a>.  This was for a couple of reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Although <a href="http://shiftedit.net/">ShiftEdit</a> is free (for what I wanted to do) it didn&rsquo;t offer SSL access, which was a bit of a downer</p></li>
<li><p> <a href="http://c9.io/">Cloud9 IDE</a> seems to be under far more active development, with exciting recent announcements about <a href="http://cloud9ide.posterous.com/windows-azure-on-cloud9">Azure integration</a></p></li>
</ol>


<p>One thing I should note about <a href="http://c9.io/">Cloud9 IDE</a>, is that in order to secure access to your projects you normally need to purchase the premium subscription, i.e:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Create_New_Project.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Create_New_Project_thumb.png" alt="Create_New_Project" /></a></p>

<p>However, when it comes to FTP projects, it is only you that gets access:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Create_New_Project_-_FTP.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Create_New_Project_-_FTP_thumb.png" alt="Create_New_Project_-_FTP" /></a></p>

<p>Now, I have to admit that other people getting access to my FTP Server was something that I was worried about, and I wanted to test to make sure that it wasn&rsquo;t publicly accessible.  To test this I sent a DM on Twitter to Phil Leggetter and asked him to try to get in, and this is what he was met with:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/denied-access.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/denied-access_thumb.png" alt="denied access" /></a></p>

<p>However, what is interesting, is that you &ldquo;can&rdquo; grant access to users through the <a href="http://c9.io/">Cloud9 IDE</a> dashboard, once they request access, which is a really nice touch:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Cloud9_Dashboard.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Cloud9_Dashboard_thumb.png" alt="Cloud9_Dashboard" /></a></p>

<p>Sorry Phil, I denied your request to join the project :).</p>

<p>All in all, this is a VERY polished application, and I would highly recommend checking it out.  The GitHub and BitBucket integration is seamless, and <em>just</em> works!  Make sure you check it out.</p>

<p>If you are interested in checking out the result of my <em>hacking </em>I have uploaded my changes to my GitHub site <a href="https://github.com/gep13/NowReadingReloaded13">here</a>.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I have just read a very interesting blog post from Barry Mooring regarding using the <a href="http://webapps.stackexchange.com/">Web Applications website</a> when you have questions about a particular application. In case you missed it, you can see the blog post <a href="http://blog.codingbadger.com/blog/2012/january/web-applications-you-are-looking-in-the-wrong-place/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Barry makes a really good point about tailoring the place that you are searching for an answer to your question, to the place that will most likely have the answer to your question, rather than simply a blanket Google search. This in itself is a great idea.</p>

<p>However, there is one thing that I think is missing from Barry’s post though (sorry Barry, in no way a criticism <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/wlEmoticon-smile5.png" alt="Smile" />), and that is first of all going to the Web Applications website to then do your search. Personally, I would prefer to set up a Custom Search Engine within Google Chrome, rather than first navigating to the site. I do this all the time for things that I find myself doing over and over again. For instance, I have a Custom Google Search Engine for <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/google-chrome-search-for-msdn/">finding information on MSDN</a> (NOTE: This blog post needs updating to the latest version of Google Chrome, but you get the idea). And the same thing can be done for Web Applications:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Custom_Google_Search.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Custom_Google_Search_thumb.png" alt="Custom_Google_Search" /></a></p>

<p>Here I have added a Search Engine with the following settings:</p>

<p>  <table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="628" ><tbody >       <tr >       <br/>
<td width="200" valign="top" >Name:

<p>This means that in the Google Chrome Omnibox I can simply type:</p>

<blockquote>  
> 
> webapp <then the tab key> &#8220;What you want to search for” <then press the enter key>
> 
> </blockquote>


<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Web_Application_Search.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Web_Application_Search_thumb.png" alt="Web_Application_Search" /></a></p>

<p>This has the benefit of doing the search, and the navigation to the website in one action, rather than two.</p>

<p>Personally, this is a much better flow for me, and one that I use on a daily basis. I highly recommend that you sit back and look at things you are doing over and over again, and look for ways that you can optimize this.</p>

<p>For sites that don’t have a their search page available on the query string, you can use Google’s built in function to limit the search to a specific domain. For instance, over at VBForums, I can use the following Custom Search Engine:</p>

<p> <table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="817" ><tbody >     <tr >     <br/>
<td width="200" valign="top" >Name:
</td>      <br/>
<td width="615" valign="top" >VBForums
</td>     </tr>      <tr >     <br/>
<td width="200" valign="top" >Keyword:
</td>      <br/>
<td width="615" valign="top" >vbforums
</td>     </tr>      <tr >     <br/>
<td width="200" valign="top" >URL:
</td>      <br/>
<td width="615" valign="top" ><a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=site:vbforums.com+%s">http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=site:vbforums.com+%s</a>
</td>     </tr>   </tbody></table></p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>As a birthday gift last year I was given a 4 hour Photography Training Course with Apex Photographics (thank you again Caroline!).  You can find their website <a href="http://apexphotographics.co.uk/">here</a>.  After finally sitting down to decide when I will be doing this course, I have decided to go along on Monday 6th February.  I had originally booked it for Saturday 4th, but due to the fact that I am now attending <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/i-am-attending-the-uk-tech-days-in-london/">UK Tech Days</a> in London, I am not able to make it at the weekend.  I have no idea what to expect from the course, as I haven’t taken any proper pictures for a long time now (you can see some of my efforts on flickr <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gep13/">here</a>), but I am very much looking forward to learning something new.  I will post back once I have attended the tuition, and I will upload some of the photos that I take.</p>

<p>On another note, after hearing the news that the Nikon <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/photography-video-capture/cameras/nikon-d700-d300s-discontinued-1057814?src=rss&amp;attr=all">D700 is being discontinued</a>, now is maybe a good time to start thinking about a new camera as well <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/wlEmoticon-smile4.png" alt="Smile" /></p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Today I saw some tweets on Twitter hinting at the fact that a new update was available for Windows Phone, so when I got home tonight I plugged my HTC HD7 phone into my laptop, and sure enough, there was an update available!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/1._Update_Available.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/1._Update_Available_thumb.png" alt="1._Update_Available" /></a></p>

<p>Clicking on update presented me with more information about this update:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2._Update_Your_Phone.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2._Update_Your_Phone_thumb.png" alt="2._Update_Your_Phone" /></a></p>

<p>In case it is not clear from the picture this update includes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Fixes an on-screen keyboard issue to prevent the keyboard from disappearing during typing.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixes a Gmail syncing issue.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixes a location access issue. With this fix, the Me feature in the People Hub sends anonymous information about nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers to Microsoft only if you agree to allow the Check In function to access and use location information.</p></li>
<li><p>Revokes digital certificates from DigiCert Sdn Bhd to address an encryption issue.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixes an email issue related to Microsoft Exchange Server 2003. With this fix, when you reply to or forward a message, the original message is now included in your response.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixes a voicemail notification issue.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>For full information about this update, be sure to check out the site <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/howto/wp7/basics/update-history.aspx">here</a>.</p>

<p>After doing a quick check that everything was ready to go, I opted to start the update. Thankfully, the installer reminded me of this important fact:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/3._Plug_in_computer.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/3._Plug_in_computer_thumb.png" alt="3._Plug_in_computer" /></a></p>

<p>10 steps and 30 minutes later, I had a newly updated phone (the majority of this time was spent backing up the phone before applying the update).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/5._Success.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/5._Success_thumb.png" alt="5._Success" /></a></p>

<p>With this update in place, I am happy to report that I am now able to connect to my wireless internet connection in the house. I was previously having issues with this following the last update.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/i-am-attending-the-uk-tech-days-in-london/" itemprop="url">I Am Attending the UK Tech Days in London</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>With reference to my <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=571">list of events here</a>, I am happy to say that today I finished getting everything booked for attending the UK Tech Days, in London in February.</p>

<p>Microsoft are putting on two events:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://uktechdays.cloudapp.net/upcoming-events/windows-azure-bootcamp-(london">Windows Azure Bootcamp – 3rd February 2012</a>.aspx)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://uktechdays.cloudapp.net/upcoming-events/windows-phone-camp-(london">Windows Phone Camp – 4th February 2012</a>.aspx)</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>NOTE: If you can’t make the London events, the events are being repeated in Bristol the following week. Information <a href="http://uktechdays.cloudapp.net/upcoming-events/windows-azure-bootcamp-(bristol">here</a>.aspx) and <a href="http://uktechdays.cloudapp.net/upcoming-events/windows-phone-camp-(bristol">here</a>.aspx).</strong></p>

<p>Now that the hassle of getting the flights etc. booked has passed, I am very much looking forward to both of these events!</p>

<p>With the exception of a review that I did for a devFusion article, which made use of Windows Azure, I haven’t done anything with it. I am very interested to learn <em>exactly </em>what it is, how and where it can be used, and also how easily it can be integrated into existing applications. For instance, I recently saw this new <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/windows-azure-storage/">WordPress plugin</a> from Microsoft. This type of integration is very interesting, and I am curious to see how this could work elsewhere.</p>

<p>I have been “dabbling” with Windows Phone 7 for a while now, but I haven’t given it the attention that it needs to learn it properly, and I am hoping that the Windows Phone Bootcamp will be the kick-start that is required. After all, I have the developer account ready and waiting, just no applications to push onto the Marketplace. In addition, I will also get the opportunity to finally meet Pete Vickers (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/petevick">@petevick</a>) from <a href="http://appamundi.com/">AppaMundi</a> in person. I have “known” Pete for a while now as he hangs out on the Mobile Development Forums over at <a href="http://www.vbforums.com/forumdisplay.php?f=70">VBForums</a>, and it will be great to catch up at the event.</p>

<p>If you are thinking about attending these events I would strongly encourage you to get registered as soon as possible as some of them have gone to the waiting list stage and you may miss out.</p>

<p>If you are not able to make it, keep an eye on this blog as I intend to do posts over the course of the weekend, so hopefully I can keep you up to date with what I learn while I am there.</p>
