	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Me and Lynn were out shopping yesterday, and I ended up buying Guitar Hero World Tour, I couldn&rsquo;t resist it!!! Bought it for the PS3, and I have to say, so far, it is looking very good!! Has got a good range of songs, and if I can ever get my wireless connection to the PS3 working properly, I will be able to download more songs to it as well.</p>

<p>Have started playing straight away on the Medium setting, and so far no real problems. Going to have to do some work to get up to Hard though!!</p>

<p>Lynn also bought Sing Star for the PS3 as well, which she is really good at. Let&rsquo;s just say that I am not very good at it!!! The microphone for Sing Star also works with Guitar Hero, so that is a bit of a boost. Got need to get some drums now</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Lynn had organised tickets to go and see <a href="http://www.vampiresrock.com/index.htm">Vampires Rock</a> tonight. I had no idea what it was all about, so had no idea what to expect, but I have to say that it was really good!!!</p>

<p>Steve Steinman, the guy who runs it, also does a Meatloaf Tour which Lynn had also been to, that is how she know about Vampires Rock. It was basically a musical, that followed the story of the Baron, and how he is looking for a new mate. The difference being that the songs are all classic rock songs. It was all very well done!!!</p>

<p>The production also included Toya Wilcox, who also did a great job.</p>

<p>I have to be honest, at the start, I thought the band was faking playing the instruments, but it became clear that they definitely weren&rsquo;t, they were just very talented. The band was called the Lost Boys.</p>

<p>Steinman is coming back to Aberdeen in April next year for another show which I think we are going to go along to as well.</p>

<p>We hung around after the performance and got some autographs, and I got my photo taken with one of the dancers:</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Went along to The Feeling Concert last night at the Music Hall, had a great time, they put on a really good show that had the whole crowd jumping.</p>

<p>They were supported by a very energetic Belgium band called <a href="http://www.daspop.com/">Das Pop</a>. A couple of their songs were catchy but they seemed like quite an odd group. One of the guitar players looked a bit like Grizzly Adams, and the lead singer as well as singing was trying to play the piano, the tambourine, and sing all at the same time, which seemed a bit strange.</p>

<p>The Feeling themselves were very good. Again, I hadn&rsquo;t had a chance to listen to their second album, so a couple of the songs I didn&rsquo;t recognise, but most of them I did. At one point Dan Gillespie jumps into the outstretched arms of the audience and crowd surfed his way along to his awaiting minder, and then went to the upstairs balcony to perform a solo instrumental song. Very well done!!!</p>

<p>This was the second time that I have seen The Feeling, and would definitely go back and see them again.</p>

<p>I took some photos, and you can see them below:</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I was introduced to the following utility by a colleague at work:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fiastarta.com/PrtScr/">www.fiastarta.com/PrtScr/</a></p>

<p>It is a very useful utility, that is very unobtrusive, and I can see me using it on a daily basis.</p>

<p>It basically takes over when you press the “Print Screen” key on your keyboard, and allows you to perform additional activities, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>crop only a selected rectangle</p></li>
<li><p>crop only a selected area by drawing a “lasso” around the desired area</p></li>
<li><p>draw lines onto the selected area, i.e. an arrow, or some text</p></li>
<li><p>drag the highlighted area into other applications, such as Skype, MSN etc</p></li>
<li><p>open the image directly in your default image application</p></li>
<li><p>direct the image directly to an email or your clipboard</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Overall, it is very, very clever!!! And I highly recommend it.</p>

		<p>Went to see the new Bond Film, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0830515/">Quantum of Solace</a>, this morning. I was down in Glasgow with Lynn, and after not being able to go on the Tour that I wanted to, decided to go to the cinema instead. And I am glad that I did!! I really enjoyed the film!!</p>

<p>The action sequences, and the fight scenes were amazing. I did think that the film jumped around a little bit, but apart from that, a very good film.</p>

<p>I am having to rethink the order of my “Best James Bond of All Time”. Daniel Craig has still got a lot to prove, but he is working his way up the list.</p>

		<p>Whilst waiting to try to get into the tour of the Glasgow City Chambers (which ended up not happening, only runs on week days) I took some photos with my new phone. I was quite surprised by the quality of some of the photos. I have added them below,so feel free to have a look.</p>

<p>[nggallery id=24]</p>

<p>While I was there, there was a marching band that led a procession for placing a poppy wreath at the base of the statue. That was interesting to watch.</p>

		<p>Went to see Oasis at the Exhibition Centre last night, it was an amazing concert!!!</p>

<p>This was the first time that I had seen Oasis, and I was really looking forward to it, and they didn&rsquo;t disappoint!!! They played a few of their new songs, which unfortunately I had heard, as I haven&rsquo;t picked up the new album yet, but they also played some of their classics. Don&#8217;&rsquo;t Look Back In Anger, Champagne SuperNova, Wonderwall, I am a Walrus&hellip;</p>

<p>It was great!!!</p>

<p>Only slight downer on the evening was that I must have got hit by about 10 pints of what I am hoping was beer. Had to go home and have a shower after the concert!!</p>

		<p>Just picked up my new phone.</p>

<p>I opted to go for the new Sony Ericsson X1, you can find details about it <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/x1/">here</a>. I haven&rsquo;t really had a chance to play with it yet, but so far, I am very impressed. Debated for a long time about getting the iPhone, but decided that I was more than likely going to run the battery down on that cause I am listening to music, and then I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to make a phone call or a send a text message, so better to keep my phone and music as two separate devices.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Today I bought myself a PlayStation 3!!!</p>

<p>Debated for a long time which would be the best thing to get. An XBox 360? A PlayStation 3? A standalone Blu-ray Player?</p>

<p>In the end, decided the PS3 would be the best, as this would give me the option of sharing files from my server, playing Blu-ray disks, and also playing the odd game. Although, to be fair, most gaming is done on the Wii, so will see how that works out.</p>

<p>Got it all hooked up today, but having some problems getting the latest firmware installed on it, going to have to look into this. Might have to temporarily use a Ethernet cable to get it installed.</p>
