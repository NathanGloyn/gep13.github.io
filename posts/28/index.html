	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Due to the fact that our business Headquarters are in Canada, there are a fair number of Canadians in our Scottish Office. One Friday evening, the Canadians decided that they were going to have a night of Nintendo Wii fun round at the company flat, and I was invited to come along. Initially, I thought that this would be a great idea, so I said that I would come along. However, later that night, my plans changed, and I wasn&rsquo;t able to come along, so I text them to let them know that I wouldn&rsquo;t be attending.</p>

<p>The following Monday, I was told that I had missed a really good night, and as the stories of the evening were recited, I realised that I probably should have attended. Days passed, and I thought that was the end of it, however, I was wrong&hellip;..</p>

<p>[singlepic id=1204 w=320 h=240 float=]</p>

<p>Turns out, that rather than be without a Gary at the party, the Canadians thought it would be a good idea to replace a Scottish Gary with someone else, and so <strong>Gary The Coconut</strong> was born.</p>

<p>Since that night, Gary The Coconut has ventured out into the world, in lots of different ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>He has got his own <a href="http://www.facebook.com/people/Gary_Park/1155266863">Facebook account</a></p></li>
<li><p>He has been Skiing</p></li>
<li><p>He has been White Water Rafting</p></li>
<li><p>He has been to a BBQ</p></li>
<li><p>He has been to lots of parties</p></li>
</ul>


<p>He has made lots of friends along the way, however, his best friend in the whole wide world has to be Wes:</p>

<p>[singlepic id=1211 w=320 h=240 float=]</p>

<p>Where will Gary The Coconut go next? No one knows&hellip;.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/calgary-stampede/" itemprop="url">Calgary Stampede</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Well, I have to say that the Calgary Stampede lived up to its expectations!! Had a really good day!!</p>

<p>Got down to the grounds just after 11, which is when the gates opened, and had a wander round the whole grounds just to see where everything was, and by the time I had done that, it was time for the Rodeo.</p>

<p>[nggallery id=10]</p>

<p>This was a really good show, especially the last event which was a kids event, it was SO funny!!! The idea was that there were three of them, they had to hold onto this small horse, long enough for one of them to jump on it&rsquo;s back and ride it for 3 jumps. The first team was able to do it no bother, but all the others ones couldn&rsquo;t do it, and most of them ended up being dragged along the ground by the horse. Very funny!! Ended up sitting next to an elderly lady who had family in Peterhead, how bizarre is that, small world eh!!</p>

<p>After the Rodeo, got in touch with Ryan, a colleague at work who I was meeting to go to the Chuck Wagons with, and arranged where we were to meet. Spend the time in between walking round the Stampede Grounds.</p>

<p>[nggallery id=11]</p>

<p>There was so much to see, including lots of vintage tractors which some of my uncle&rsquo;s would have loved, so I have taken lots of photos of them, you can see them in the above slide show.</p>

<p>Then met Ryan and it was onto the Chuck Wagons.</p>

<p>[nggallery id=9]</p>

<p>Before that though, we went to the Bar and got a couple pints and ended up bumping into a family of Scottish people from the Bridge of Allan. Had a bit of banter with them, which was good fun, was good to hear some fellow Scottish voices, although I am not sure that Ryan understood everything <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" />. We decided that we were going to bet a dollar on each race, there were nine races in total, it was neck and neck all the way, then the cheating Canadian won the last one, so I had to pay up!! All in all though, much fun was had.</p>

<p>The seats that we had were great for the Chuck Wagons, but they really weren&rsquo;t great for the Grandstand show, so decided to head to the Casino instead. Had never been to a Casino before, and this place was packed!! Ended up getting a seat on a Blackjack table, Ryan wasn&rsquo;t able to which was a real shame, and started on a bit of a winning streak!! Had a really good time, but it is easy to see how people could become addicted!!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Today was the first day of activities for the Calgary Stampede, and it started with the Parade. We were given this morning off so we could enjoy it, so I took full advantage of it. The prelude to the parade started at 0730, so I made sure that I got there early so I could get a good spot. Ended up standing behind the embankment at the bridge at 8th and 9th Avenue, which turned out to be a really good spot. You could see everything as they came over the brow of the hill.</p>

<p>As you can probably guess, I took lots of photos, and you can see them below.</p>

<p>I was really surprised by the number of Scottish things in the parade. Highland dancing, kilts, bagpipes, Reel Bands, Drummers, Pipe Bands!!! The whole show was really good though. It lasted over four and a half hours, and I was there for the whole thing. Luckily it wasn&rsquo;t too warm this morning, in fact it was quite overcast, and a couple of times I thought it was going to start raining, but luckily it didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is the start of the Stampede, and I am going to be there all day. Will post back to let you know how I got on.</p>

		<p>Went to go and see the new Angelina Jolie film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0493464/">Wanted</a> this afternoon.</p>

<p>Turns out that it is actually quite a good movie!!!</p>

<p>As long as you are willing to over look a few key things, such as the ability to <a href="http://io9.com/5018516/could-you-shoot-bendy-bullets-just-like-in-wanted">bend bullets</a>, and the <a href="http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080627013145AAjjb1F&amp;amp;show=7">ability to shoot the wings off a fly</a> then you should enjoy the film. If on the other hand, you don&rsquo;t like the completely infeasible, then I would say stay away.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>So I have booked tickets to go and see the Calgary Stampede!! Really looking forward to it, I have heard lots of good things about it.</p>

<p>The Stampede starts on Friday 4th July with a parade, which you can see details about <a href="http://parade.calgarystampede.com/">here</a>. Then every day there is a <a href="http://cs.calgarystampede.com/events/rodeo/">Rodeo</a> and then a <a href="http://cs.calgarystampede.com/events/grandstand-show.html">Grandstand</a> show. I am planning on going to both of these events on the Saturday, so hopefully it will be a nice day, so I can get lots of photos!!</p>

<p>From what I understand there are lots of rides and things to do while in the Stampede ground, so don&rsquo;t think I will be bored.</p>

<p>Will let you know how I get on!!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I was invited to go hiking today with Nick from the office.</p>

<p>Had a really great time! I thought we had some hiking trails back home in Scotland, but looks like they have got a few more over here!!</p>

<p>Got picked up at 10am, quick stop at Safeway to grab some food, and then it was off to <a href="http://maps.google.ca/maps?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;q=Kananaskis,+AB,+Canada&amp;amp;z=7&amp;amp;iwloc=addr">Kananaskis</a>.  Parked up the car, and then started hiking up a trail that Nick had spotted the last time he went hiking. Not going to lie, it was tough going, and it was quite a hot day, still not used to the temperatures over here, but we made it to the top (when I say the top, I mean the peak that we felt happy with stopping at, a couple who were hiking in front of us went a lot further, but we didn&rsquo;t think it was a good idea to follow them, they were hard-core hikers!!). We made our way back down, and then headed into Kananaskis Village, where we were going to visit Troll Falls. This turned out to be well worth it!! Basically, after a short walk through some forest, you got to a reasonably sized waterfall, where you were able to walk right up to it!! Needless to say, I took lots of photos of it, as well as some videos. If you want to look at the pictures you can see them below, if you want to see the videos, then drop me a line, and I can send them to you.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I went to see two films today&hellip;.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0949731/">The Happening</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800080/">The Incredible Hulk</a></p>

<p>Have to say that I didn&rsquo;t really enjoy The Happening. I can see what they were trying to do with the film, but just don&rsquo;t think that it came off very well. It was worth a watch, but not great!!</p>

<p>Really enjoyed The Incredible Hulk. The way the film ended it seems like there is going to be another one made, so will have to wait and see on that one.</p>

<p>Saw a couple of trailers for some upcoming films that I really want to go and see, namely:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.movieweb.com/movies/film/08/4808/summary.php">The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor</a>, I am a big fan of this series, so really looking forward to it!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.movieweb.com/movies/film/65/2065/summary.php">The X-Files: I want to believe</a>, again, big fan of all things X-Files, so hopefully this film along with Billy Connolly can live up to the name!!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>As part of the Global Petroleum Show which is going on in Calgary this week, there was a Professional Bull Riding event at the Saddledome last night. I went along with another guy from the office, and had a great time!!!!</p>

<p>To say that these guys are nuts would be a little bit of an understatement in my opinion!!! And as for the Bull Fighters (the guys who distract the Bull once the Bull Rider falls off so that the Bull doesn&rsquo;t go for him, those guys at just not right in the head!!!) You can see some of the photos that I took while at the show here:</p>

<p>[nggallery id=6]</p>

<p>Some of them aren&rsquo;t very good because I was told that I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to use my camera, so i just used the camera on my phone, but then I saw other people using cameras that were better than mine, so I took mine out my bag and took a few shots. Hope you like them!!</p>

<p>The commentator told us that one of the Bulls that was used in the final round, which was called The Microsoft Challenge Round (wonder how much Microsoft had to pay for that privilege?!?), was over 1 tonne in weight!!! Needless to say, it threw the rider off pretty quickly, and the rider was eliminated from the contest. In the final round, out of the eight riders, there was only one guy who was able to stay on the Bull for the required 8 seconds.</p>

<p>I have got some videos that I took on the night as well, if anyone is interesting in seeing them, leave me a comment, or get in touch direct, and I can send them onto you (have quite got videos working on my site yet, I will at some point though :-))</p>

<p>[singlepic id=326 w=320 h=240 float=]</p>

<p>&hellip;I did!! When I was at the Cinema last weekend to see the new Indiana Jones Movie, I saw the &ldquo;A Taste of Britain&rdquo; store. It was closed, but through the window I could see some Irn Bru. I went back there this Friday just past after work and I bought some.  It was £1.60 for a bottle, but it was well worth it!!!</p>
