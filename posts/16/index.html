	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/using-a-wp7-to-automate-my-house/" itemprop="url">Using a WP7 to Automate My House…</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Ok, that is clearly a little bit of an exaggeration, I haven’t automated my whole house, but I have automated a very small portion of it. What am I talking about? And why am I writing a blog about it? Read on, and all will be revealed :)</p>

<p>Last weekend while I was at <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=210">DDD Scotland</a> I got talking to <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/richardadalton">@richardadalton</a> and during an enthralling conversation about the Commodore 64 (I really think I want to fire up my old C64, but I am worried about whether it would blow up cause it’s so old. I could always get myself one of <a href="http://www.commodoreusa.net/CUSA_C64.aspx">these</a> though), I got a phone call from my wife asking if I would “switch of the internet”, to which I responded with, “sure, no problem”, and I promptly did so.</p>

<p>Now bear in mind, I was 150 miles away at the time. How did I do this? Using my Windows Phone 7 of course!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image3.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image_thumb3.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>I should clarify that in my house, switching off the internet actually translates as switching off the wireless antenna of our ADSL Router. The need to do this stems from the fact that we use a wireless TV sender to take the Sky Television signal from the Sky+ box downstairs to the television upstairs, and when the wireless antenna in the ADSL router is on, we get interference on the upstairs television.</p>

<p>Now, as I can hear <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/barryoconnor">@barryoconnor</a> saying, “why not just get Sky Multi-Room?” The reason is two fold. 1) We don’t watch enough TV upstairs to warrant another feed, and more importantly 2) I am cheap <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/wlEmoticon-smile1.png" alt="Smile" /></p>

<p>To start with, the solution to this problem was to simply kill the power to the wireless router. However, this was bad for a couple reasons. Firstly, it isn’t great for the device itself, just having the power pulled from it. And secondly, switching off the power stopped all inbound traffic, which given that I run a couple services from a server in my house, isn’t ideal. Also, the five minutes it takes to switch on another computer, to log into the router to switch it off is just too much like hard work!</p>

<p>NOTE: I tried every combination of wireless channel on both the router and the wireless sender, and none of them stopped the interference.</p>

<p>Jump forward a couple months, and a new solution presented itself in the form of a Windows Phone 7 application, which you can see a screen shot of above. This is a VERY simple application, and I certainly won’t be winning any prizes for design, but it serves it’s purpose. So, what does it do?</p>

<p>The router that I own, like many others, has a built in web server, that allows the administration of the device using a web interface. By logging into this web interface, and cracking open <a href="http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/">Fiddler</a>, I was able to figure out the necessary HTTP Post data in order to enable and disable the wireless antenna of the device. With this information, I was then able to create an <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.httpwebrequest.aspx">HttpWebRequest</a> in code with the required settings to actually enable/disable the wireless router from the button click on the Windows Phone 7. Below the buttons is a WebBrowser control which is used to simply show the response that is received from the request, as due to timeouts and other interwebs going ons, the first request doesn’t always work.</p>

<p>A recent refactoring of the project included creating a Web Service to do the actual work of talking to the Router, and all my Phone application has to do is call the Web Service methods.</p>

<p>An earlier Windows Mobile 6.5 version of this application went as far as to intercept incoming text messages with a known format from another phone to enable/disable the wireless antenna, but the Windows Phone 7 API does not expose the ability to intercept text messages (hopefully this will be available in later versions of the OS).</p>

<p>There are a couple extensions that I would like to add to this application, such as finding out the current state of the wireless router, i.e. enabled/disabled, but as yet, I haven’t had time to get round to it. One day…</p>

<p>For a slightly shorter explanation of how all this works, have a look <a href="http://www.tweetdeck.com/twitter/richardadalton/~PAHAI">here</a>.</p>

<p>If anyone out there wants some more information on this insanely over complicated set up, feel free to get in touch.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/vmware-workstation-troubles/" itemprop="url">VMWare Workstation Troubles…</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>At work, I use Windows 7 as the base operating system for my Desktop machine. It is a reasonably beefy machine, with an Intel i7 CPU and 8GB of RAM. The idea is that we can host multiple VM’s at the same time for development purposes.</p>

<p>In order to host the VM’s, I had both VMWare Workstation 6.5 installed, as well as Microsoft Virtual PC. Why the two virtualisation products I hear you ask? Well, let me tell you…</p>

<p>In order to connect to some clients network, we have to use a proprietary VPN Client, and unfortunately, this does not work on Windows 7, only Windows XP. Now, I could have just installed a copy of Windows XP using VMWare Wokstation (which is our default virtualisation product) however, that would have required a retail version of the OS, rather than the MSDN ones that we use for development purposes. As a result, I decided to enable the WIndows XP Mode on my Windows 7 host operating system, which I thought was a particularly sensible solution.</p>

<p>However, when I tried to run up Windows XP Mode at the same time as a VM hosted in VMWare Workstation, I was greeted with the following:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/VMWare-Workstation-troubles_11F5D/image.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/VMWare-Workstation-troubles_11F5D/image_thumb.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>Followed by this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/VMWare-Workstation-troubles_11F5D/image_3.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/VMWare-Workstation-troubles_11F5D/image_thumb_3.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>This actually crashed the VMWare Workstation hosted VM, and resulted in some corruption of one of me VM’s <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/VMWare-Workstation-troubles_11F5D/wlEmoticon-sadsmile.png" alt="Sad smile" /></p>

<p>Initially, I resigned myself to only having one virtualisation software running at once, as I couldn’t find an immediate solution to the problem.</p>

<p>However, talking to a colleague at work, who does the exact same thing as I was trying to do, said he was able to get it working no problem. Turns out, he was running VMware Workstation 7, not version 6.5.</p>

<p>A quick install, and I am happy to say that everything is now working perfectly</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/visual-studio-2010-crashes-when-i-open-build-details-page/" itemprop="url">Visual Studio 2010 Crashes When I Open Build Details Page</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>For that last few weeks I have noticed that every time I try to open a build details screen from my Team Foundation Server within Visual Studio 2010 I was greeted with this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image_thumb.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p><em>NOTE: By build details screen I mean the TFS build details screen which you can get to via Team Explorer | Builds | View Builds and then double click on an available completed build</em></p>

<p>The details of the event didn’t really provide much insight into what might be going on:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image1.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image_thumb1.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<pre><code>[![image](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image_thumb2.png)](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image2.png)  
</code></pre>

<p>But due to the fact that I am in the process of transitioning the code base from Visual Studio 2008 to Visual Studio 2010 there really wasn’t much of a push to get this working, as I could simply jump back to my 2008 VM and check what I needed.</p>

<p>The other day though I found myself with a couple minutes, so I thought that I would look into getting the problem fixed. A quick Bing turned up the following:</p>

<p><a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/Downloads/DownloadDetails.aspx?DownloadID=34824">http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/Downloads/DownloadDetails.aspx?DownloadID=34824</a></p>

<p>The description of the error:</p>

<blockquote>  
> 
> Visual Studio 2010 SP1 crashes or shows the following error when attempting to view a build report on a TFS 2008 server:
> 
>    
> 
> &#8220;TF50316: The following name is not valid. Verify that the name does not exceed the maximum character limit, only contains valid characters, and is not a reserved name&#8221;
> 
> </blockquote>


<p>Seemed to fit my problem exactly. I had installed Service Pack 1 for Visual Studio 2010 recently, and I don’t recall the build details screen working since then, and we are still using TFS 2008, so I thought I would give it a try, nothing to lose.</p>

<p>Thankfully, once this fix was installed, the build details page started working again.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Hot of the heels of <a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/ddd9/">DDD9</a> which I <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=28">attended in January</a>, this weekend was the turn of <a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/scotland2011/">DDD Scotland</a>.</p>

<p>Again, I had never attended this event before, and having seen what was on offer at DDD9 I was hopeful of more of the same, and I am happy to say that I was not disappointed. The <a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/scotland2011/Schedule.aspx">list of sessions</a> was immense and it actually made it quite difficult to choose which session of the five available that I wanted to attend.</p>

<p>On the day, this was made even worse by the additional of an alternative track which added another session to the mix. I decided to stick with my original selections, however some of the feedback from the alternative track sessions made me wish I had attended some of them (especially the “Agile is Dead”, and “How to Manage Your Manager” talks, but hindsight is a wonderful thing.</p>

<p>Personally, I think the sixth track worked out quite well, and hopefully this is something that the organisers can keep going with.</p>

<p>Speaking of the organisers, I have to congratulate Andy Gibson (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/argibson">@argibson</a>), Craig Murphy (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/camurphy">@camurphy</a>), Colin MacKay (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/colinmackay">@colinmackay</a>) and Barry Carr (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/barrycarr">@barrycarr</a>) (as well as all their helpers) for all their hard work! It really paid off, it was a great day, keep up the great work (and if you need any help, feel free to ask).</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/scotland2011/ViewSession.aspx?SessionID=676">Session 1</a> – Creating you Own Software Company: A Survival Guide</strong></p>

<p><strong>Presenter – Kendall Miller (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/kendallmiller">@kendallmiller</a>)</strong></p>

<p>Creating my own software company is certainly not something that I am thinking about, but this session was still very interesting. Kendall was very open about his experiences in setting up <a href="http://www.gibraltarsoftware.com/">Gibraltar Software</a>, and it gave some very interesting insights into the the thought processes behind setting up a business. For instance, pricing is not really something you have control over, but rather the price of your product is driven by the target audience. Kendall is a great speaker, and I would encourage anyone to attend his sessions.</p>

<p><em>Quote of the Session:</em></p>

<p><em>“That’s completely bollocks”</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/scotland2011/ViewSession.aspx?SessionID=707">Session 2</a> – Building seriously scalable websites with ASP.NET with and without Windows</strong></p>

<p><strong>Presenter – Chris Hay (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/chrishayuk">@chrishayuk</a>)</strong></p>

<p>By Chris’s own omission, this was the first time that he had given this talk, and given the amount of information that he was trying to condense into a single hour presentation, it was surprising to find that it ended up feeling a little “hectic” and “rushed”. In addition to this, the shell prompt that he was using on his Mac wasn’t really visible on the projector. However, and this is a big however, the session was still very good, and I have to give Chris a lot of credit for this. I learnt a lot from this session, including the use of <a href="http://haproxy.1wt.eu/">haproxy</a> to provide load balancing as well as the idea to split the dynamic and static content of your site onto different servers. The latter is something that I am very keen to try out. Chris mentioned that he is currently working on a book for Manning which delves deeper into the topics covered in this session, and I am looking forward to picking that book up when it comes out (although I still haven’t finished reading Azure in Action <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" />).</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/scotland2011/ViewSession.aspx?SessionID=669">Session 3</a> – Unit Testing, Test Driven Development and the Walking Skeleton</strong></p>

<p><strong>Presenter – Seb Rose (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/sebrose">@sebrose</a>)</strong></p>

<p>I have been hearing a lot about Unit Testing and TDD lately, both from fellow developers as well as online. TDD is not a philosophy that we have adapted at my work, but I was keen to learn more about it, and see how it could be applied. Seb gave a very enlightening talk, which I have to say that I enjoyed very much. (Although, he has pointed me at another couple books which I think I have to add to my growing collection, I have no idea when I am going to get round to reading them all). I especially like the myths that Seb dispelled during his talk, including “Why should I fix it? It’s not my code!”.</p>

<p><strong>Grok Talks</strong></p>

<p>Time was set aside at lunch time for some short Grok talks. However, due to the heat in the main room, I was only able to stay for a couple before heading outside to grab some air.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/scotland2011/ViewSession.aspx?SessionID=718">Session 4</a> – Real World SLUT (Silverlight Unit Testing)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Presenter – Daniel May (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/danielrmay">@danielrmay</a>)</strong></p>

<p>I was really looking forward to this talk as it had some direct relevance to the work that I am currently doing. Although I was able to take a few things from it, I sort of felt that the session morphed into a discussion of separation of concerns between your View and ViewModel, rather than on Unit Testing Silverlight applications. Obviously, this topic needs to be touched on in terms of setting up your application to the point that it can be unit tested, but based on the description of the session, I don’t think this was appropriate. In addition, given some extra time at the end of the session, there was an attempt at an impromptu demo to illustrate another concept. Although it was clear where the demo was going, it was clearly unrehearsed, and I don’t think it helped aid the description of the point.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/scotland2011/ViewSession.aspx?SessionID=688">Session 5</a> – Introduction to Kanban</strong></p>

<p><strong>Presenter – Chris McDermott (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/chrisvmcd">@chrisvmcd</a>)</strong></p>

<p>This was a very good session. Given a recent failed attempt at adopting SCRUM within a project, I was interested to see how a Kanban approach (where the philosophy of small incremental changes to a process is adopted) could work in a real life environment. Chris was able to draw on his experiences very well to put his point across. I specifically liked the retrospective that he did in terms of applying the Kanban approach to an old project that hadn’t used Kanban. It was nice to see where if Kanban had been used, the project could have been a lot better.</p>

<p><em>Quote of the Session:</em></p>

<p><em>“Stop starting and start finishing”</em></p>

<p><strong>Geek Dinner – China Buffet King</strong></p>

<p>After the fiasco of the Chinese meal for the Pre-Conference Dinner at DDD9 I think there was some concern that there might be a repeat here, but thankfully there wasn’t. Both the service and the food were amazing, to the point that no sooner had we finished a beer, another one would appear in front of us, amazing!!</p>

<p>After the meal it was back to the Ramada Jarvis hotel for a couple more drinks, and lots of interesting geek related chat! Following that a few braver soles decided that they would continue into the small hours of the morning, but I decided that enough was enough, and retired to bed. After seeing some of the <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/stack72/status/67136082424242176">tweets this morning</a>, I think I made the right decision <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" /></p>

<p><strong>Overall Thoughts of DDD Scotland</strong></p>

<p>Can’t say enough good things about it! I bring that many people into one place, and provide such a wide array of sessions and topics is just phenomenal. I don’t mind making long trips to places like Reading and Bristol for events like this, but given that this event is so close, there really is no excuse not to attend, and I would highly encourage all developers based in Scotland to come along.</p>

<p>Congratulations again to all the organisers, you did a great job, and you should be very proud!!!</p>

<p>The single criticism that I would have (and this is no fault of the organisers) is that the rooms did start to get very warm, uncomfortably so at times.</p>

<p>Remember, if you attended the conference, remember to check out the <a href="http://www.typemock.com/win">TypeMock website</a> for your chance to win some goodies!</p>

<p>I am looking forward to attending <a href="http://www.dddsouthwest.com/">DDD SW</a> (Bristol) next month, I just need to figure out how I am getting there and where I will be staying.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Through the <a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/">Aberdeen Developers website</a> I have been made aware of a job vacancy in the Aberdeen area.</p>

<p>The role will be as a software developer working on a brand new browser based product. In the short term, a prospective candidate would benefit from having some Delphi knowledge in order to work with some existing software. In addition, it would be beneficial if the candidate lived in the Aberdeen/Aberdeenshire area. The position would also ideally suit someone who has, or is, working on their own concept and wants to be a “start up”, and is looking for some cash injection, as this type of investment is available.</p>

<p>If you are interested in the position and would like some more information, then please feel free to contact Peter Gillian on pjg at skylark dot co dot uk, or you can call him on 01330 823950.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/software-development-packages/" itemprop="url">Software Development Packages</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I have been giving a lot of thought about the development software packages that I use on a daily basis (both at work and at home), and which ones, if any, I should change out. For example, I have been hearing a lot of good things about TeamCity (for the purposes of Continuous Integration) and CodeRush/ReSharper as IDE Productivity Tools.</p>

<p>As a result, I am looking to get some opinions from some fellow developers about what they are using.</p>

<p>What I currently use is the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Development Environment – Visual Studio 2010</p></li>
<li><p>Source Control – TFS</p></li>
<li><p>Continuous Integration – TFS</p></li>
<li><p>Work Item Management – TFS</p></li>
<li><p>Unit Testing – MSTest</p></li>
<li><p>Integration Testing – Nothing at the minute <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/517cd9ae4196_12CEC/wlEmoticon-sadsmile.png" alt="Sad smile" /></p></li>
<li><p>IDE Productivity Tools – StyleCop, Code Analysis</p></li>
<li><p>Various Visual Studio 2010 <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=3">Extensions</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>So basically, what I am hoping for is feedback on what you use, either at home or at work, and what you like about the packages that you use. Am I missing anything critical? Are there any software packages for development purposes that you are using, that you now simply couldn’t live without?</p>

<p>All opinions are welcome!</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/oreilly-media-ftw-oreillymedia/" itemprop="url">O’Reilly Media – FTW!!</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>If like me, you have a LOT of books, then I would highly suggest that you take a look at the O’Reilly Media website:</p>

<p><a href="http://oreilly.com/">http://oreilly.com/</a></p>

<p>Not only do they offer some cracking deals on both print and eBooks (you can follow <a href="http://www.twitter.com/OReillyMedia">@oReillyMedia</a> to get the “Deal of the Day”) but as a registered member, you then get access to additional functionality that, to me, is now becoming “must have”.</p>

<p>To start off with, as a registered member, you have the option to register all the print books that you have in your library.  This is as simple as typing in the ISBN number of each book, and once you have done that, the website then provides you with links off to any errata&rsquo;s for the book, as well as any downloadable content.</p>

<p>As an example, take a look at the “Inside the Microsoft Build Engine” book that I have in my collection (I picked this one up while I was at DDD Reading):</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/OReilly-Media_BA9D/image.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/OReilly-Media_BA9D/image_thumb.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> not all books are supported by the O’Reilly site, but I would say that over 70% of my collection was.</p>

<p>So, rather having to bookmark any additional content or changes to the book, I can simply log into my O’Reilly account and keep everything in one place.</p>

<p>On top of this, O’Reilly also offer you the ability to do an eBook upgrade of some of your books.  What this means is that you can download a digital version of the physical books that you own.  This means that you can easily take your book collection with you, let’s say if you own a Kindle.</p>

<p>Most books are available in a wide range of formats including APK, MOBI, PDF, DAISY and ePub.  Of course this service isn’t free, but for the small price that you have to pay, I personally think that it is well worth it.</p>

<p>There were a number of Microsoft Press Training Kit books that weren’t originally included in the eBook upgrade offer (the MCTS and MCPD Self Paced Training Kit books), but I am happy to say that (after a talk with a O’Reilly representative at the SharePoint Best Practices conference in London) I have now found out that these have been included in the deal.</p>

<p>For more information about the available membership benefits available from O’Reilly take a look here:</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>So, after weeks of waiting, the Nodo update has finally landed on my HTC HD7.</p>

<p>I didn’t get any notification on my phone, but after a day of reading tweets from people I knew were on O2 who had the update, I decided to plug my phone into computer and let the Zune software check for an update, and this is what I was greeted with:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Finally-Nodo-has-landed_11CCC/image.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Finally-Nodo-has-landed_11CCC/image_thumb.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>Clicking the UPDATE button took me through to here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Finally-Nodo-has-landed_11CCC/image_3.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Finally-Nodo-has-landed_11CCC/image_thumb_3.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>And after a quick prayer, and a deep breath, I clicked the UPDATE NOW button:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Finally-Nodo-has-landed_11CCC/image_4.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Finally-Nodo-has-landed_11CCC/image_thumb_4.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>I missed some steps as they happened so quickly:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Finally-Nodo-has-landed_11CCC/image_5.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Finally-Nodo-has-landed_11CCC/image_thumb_5.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Finally-Nodo-has-landed_11CCC/image_6.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Finally-Nodo-has-landed_11CCC/image_thumb_6.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>This step took quite a while:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Finally-Nodo-has-landed_11CCC/image_7.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Finally-Nodo-has-landed_11CCC/image_thumb_7.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>This step took even longer (go and get yourself a cup of tea):</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Finally-Nodo-has-landed_11CCC/image_8.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Finally-Nodo-has-landed_11CCC/image_thumb_8.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Finally-Nodo-has-landed_11CCC/image_9.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Finally-Nodo-has-landed_11CCC/image_thumb_9.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Finally-Nodo-has-landed_11CCC/image_10.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Finally-Nodo-has-landed_11CCC/image_thumb_10.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>Woot!!</p>

<p>Upon checking Settings | about, the OS version of my HTC HD7 is now 7.0.7390.0.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>About two weeks ago, I was having a chat with @deanvmc, and one of the things that we discussed was the setting up of a Hosted Exchange account for our email. At the time, I had POP3 and IMAP account for my gep13.co.uk and aberdeendevelopers.co.uk domains, and I was quite happy with them, I had never considered using anything else.</p>

<p>However, the conversation led me to investigate further, and I decided that I wanted a Hosted Exchange account for the gep13.co.uk. This would allow me to easily hook it up to my Windows Phone 7, as well as provide Outlook Web Access, and all the associated goodies such as Calendars, Contacts, Tasks, etc.</p>

<p>After looking around for a bit I went back to the original company that Dean had mentioned, a company called <a href="http://www.blacknight.com/">Blacknight</a>. I decided their package a try, for a numbers of reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Reasonably well priced</p></li>
<li><p> Geographically close (they are based in Ireland)</p></li>
<li><p> Support for Exchange 2010</p></li>
<li><p> 30 day money back guarantee is not satisfied</p></li>
</ol>


<p>A couple emails to support later, as well as chatting to <a href="http://twitter.com/blacknight">@blacknight</a> on twitter, and my Hosted Exchange account was up and running. I had access to Webmail, I was connected to it via my Windows Phone 7, and I was connected to it via Outlook on my desktop. Things really did “just work”, and I really can’t recommend them enough!!</p>

<p>After a couple days, I was on the <a href="http://www.blacknight.com/">Blacknight</a> website again, and I happened to look at their <a href="http://www.blacknight.com/shared-hosting.html">web hosting packages</a>, and I was quite literally stunned!! Hosting for 30 domains, and 30 of each kind of database, or that price?!? I felt sure something must be wrong!!</p>

<p>So again, a couple emails to support to confirm a couple details, i.e. support for ASP.Net 4.0 and ASP.Net MVC 3, and I was sold!! My current hosting package runs out in May, but I thought I would grab the hosting package just now, and get everything set up, especially since there are <a href="http://domainoffers.me/">discounts</a> available.</p>

<p>The Blacknight control panel is very intuitive to use, and has access to just about everything that you need to get your websites up and running. I have to say that there were a couple things missing in the control panel compared to my old host, i.e. the ability to specify that the application pool is running under .Net 4.0, but with the speedy response that I have been getting from the support team, this really isn’t a problem.</p>

<p>I am happy to say that after a few initial small teething problems, my gep13.co.uk site is up and running (again, support were immense throughout this process, I won’t mention names as I don’t think I am “allowed” to, but they have all been very helpful!)</p>

<p>Now that gep13.co.uk is working, I will start the transition of the aberdeendevelopers.co.uk site on their servers as well, but I can’t see any reason why this again shouldn’t “just work”.</p>

<p>On top of the Exchange and Web Hosting, <a href="http://www.blacknight.com/">Blacknight</a> also offer another interesting service called <a href="http://rss.me/">rss.me</a>. I have joined the Beta program for this, and this blog post will actually be the first one which should automatically be picked up by it and posted to my twiiter feed, so fingers crossed!</p>

<p>As the title of this blog post states, I really can’t say enough good things about <a href="http://www.blacknight.com/">Blacknight</a>, and if you are in the market for a new web host I would highly encourage you to check them out!! Keep up the good work guys!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>In the last 3 months, I have had to rebuild 3 separate PC’s, from scratch, i.e. re-format the hard drive, re-install OS, and put all applications back on again.  All of them have been development rigs, my home desktop, my personal laptop, and work development machine.</p>

<p>Each time I did this, I had to think about what applications I wanted to install, and what configuration changes I have to make to each application once installed.  What was missing is a comprehensive list of what to install, and what to configure, so this is where this blog post is going to come in.</p>

<p>It will serve as a reference to me when I need to re-install again.  My aim is to keep it up to date with any “new” applications I add to my systems.  The order in which the applications appear in their groups is typically the order in which I install them.</p>
