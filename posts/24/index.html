		<p>If anyone is thinking about sitting a Microsoft Exam in the near future, you might want to think about taking advantage of the Microsoft Second Shot Voucher scheme.  Details can be found here:</p>

		<p>I am very jealous!!! My sister and her partner have just got a new dog, a German Shepherd. Her name is Harlo, and she is 7 weeks old. You can see some pictures of her below:</p>

<p>[nggallery id=31]</p>

<p>I have always wanted a German Shepherd, ever since I was little, so you better believe I will be offering to dog-sit.</p>

<p>We went round to visit her tonight, and she is very cute!!!</p>

<p>UPDATE: My sister and her partner actually now have a second dog.  She is called Kiwi, and she is a Black Labrador.  You can see some photos of her below:</p>

		<p>We went along to the Peterhead Panto last night with it&rsquo;s production of Snow White and the 7 Normal Sized people Brainy, Fussy, Forgetful, Wabbit, Bossy, Lanky and Gypit.</p>

<p>I thought the show was actually quite funny, there were several parts that had me laughing. Especially the Night Vision Goggles and the Dame, who I thought was very funny.</p>

<p>It is on all this week, so if you get a chance, I would head along.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Last night was the Matrikon Christmas Party, and it was at the Ardoe House Hotel. We had 7 tables, and there were a number of other companies there as well, so it was a good atmosphere.</p>

<p>I thought the meal was very good, but I heard some people that they didn&rsquo;t like it very much, “turkey was too dry”, “dessert was disgusting”, etc., but I really liked it.</p>

<p>Wes took the role of Paparazzi for the evening, so I am hoping that he has got some good shots. I will try and get the photos from him and put them up on the website.</p>

<p>The night ended with the obligatory rendition was Runrig&rsquo;s Loch Lomond, which was a lot of fun, and then it was home to bed.</p>

<p>The photos from the night can be seen here:</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>This weekend was my birthday, and Lynn and myself spent the weekend together with a number of different activities.</p>

<p>The first was Clubland on Friday night at the Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Centre. To say I felt a little bit old at the event would be a little bit of an understatement. The event was full of lot of young people wearing very little clothes!!! I think there is going to be a major flu epidemic hitting Aberdeen in the next few days. Have to say though, I had quite a good time, didn&rsquo;t know many of the songs, or the artists, but it was good. You can see the pictures below:</p>

<p>[nggallery id=28]</p>

<p>We then went down to Glasgow to spend the weekend. We took the Mega Bus down rather than the train this time, but that was fine. We stayed in the same Holiday Inn by Express that we stayed in last time. Once we arrived we went for a meal at Di Maggio&rsquo;s, it was really nice!!! Then we took a taxi to The Saw Doctors concert at The Barrow Lands. I had a really good time, they put on a really good show!! I picked up a new t-shirt and the new CD, which I am looking forward to listening too. You can see the photos from the concert below:</p>

<p>[nggallery id=29]</p>

<p>Sunday was spent doing some shopping, and then we went to see the new Angelina Jolie film, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0824747/">Changeling</a>. It was quite a sad story, but it was a really good watch.</p>

<p>In the evening we went to the <a href="http://www.jongleurs.com/">Jongleurs</a> comedy club. We got a table for two right at the front of the stage, we were a little concerned that we were going to get picked on, but we didn&rsquo;t. The three comics that were there were very funny, and I would fully recommend going along. There was one annoying girl in the crowd who thought she was funny, and was continually trying to heckle the comics, but she ended up coming across very annoying!! Towards the end I think she got the idea, and stopped heckling.</p>

<p>We came back up the road on the Mega Bus again on Monday afternoon, after having a great weekend.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Lynn and I met up with folks and my sister and her boyfriend and his son for a meal this afternoon at the Mill of Mundurno and it was really nice!!!</p>

<p>The food was really nice, and the place looks like it has just been done up, so I would definitely recommend it!!</p>

<p>Couldn&rsquo;t decide what I was going to have, but ended up choosing the Steak Pie (substituting the Mash and Peas for Chips and Beans) and it was lovely. For dessert you were able to choose a small portion of three different desserts, so thought I would go for that. Made two very good choices, the Belgian Waffles and the Cheesecake, but the bitter chocolate pudding definitely wasn&rsquo;t to my taste.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Had my birthday night out tonight, and I have to say, I had a great time.</p>

<p>I was actually debating about not going out because of the weather, it had been snowing since Friday, and a couple of my mates had decided that they were not going to make the trip out from Peterhead in case they got stuck. Decided we should just go, and very glad we did&hellip;.</p>

<p>Finally met up with everyone at Slain&rsquo;s Castle (major problem with the taxi that we had booked, just got the bus instead) where we had an area reserved. Was able to catch up with a lot of people that I hadn&rsquo;t seen since I got back, so that was really good. I think everyone had a good time, at least I hope so.</p>

<p>I had also booked us on the guest list at Tiger Tiger, but we decided that it would be easier to get home at 1 rather than trying to get home once the club&rsquo;s kicked out. So it was in past the pie shop for a steak pie and then into the taxi queue. Again, not much luck with the taxi&rsquo;s, ended up getting the number 17X bus home.</p>

<p>Great night!!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Me and Lynn were out shopping yesterday, and I ended up buying Guitar Hero World Tour, I couldn&rsquo;t resist it!!! Bought it for the PS3, and I have to say, so far, it is looking very good!! Has got a good range of songs, and if I can ever get my wireless connection to the PS3 working properly, I will be able to download more songs to it as well.</p>

<p>Have started playing straight away on the Medium setting, and so far no real problems. Going to have to do some work to get up to Hard though!!</p>

<p>Lynn also bought Sing Star for the PS3 as well, which she is really good at. Let&rsquo;s just say that I am not very good at it!!! The microphone for Sing Star also works with Guitar Hero, so that is a bit of a boost. Got need to get some drums now</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/vampires-rock/" itemprop="url">Vampires Rock</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Lynn had organised tickets to go and see <a href="http://www.vampiresrock.com/index.htm">Vampires Rock</a> tonight. I had no idea what it was all about, so had no idea what to expect, but I have to say that it was really good!!!</p>

<p>Steve Steinman, the guy who runs it, also does a Meatloaf Tour which Lynn had also been to, that is how she know about Vampires Rock. It was basically a musical, that followed the story of the Baron, and how he is looking for a new mate. The difference being that the songs are all classic rock songs. It was all very well done!!!</p>

<p>The production also included Toya Wilcox, who also did a great job.</p>

<p>I have to be honest, at the start, I thought the band was faking playing the instruments, but it became clear that they definitely weren&rsquo;t, they were just very talented. The band was called the Lost Boys.</p>

<p>Steinman is coming back to Aberdeen in April next year for another show which I think we are going to go along to as well.</p>

<p>We hung around after the performance and got some autographs, and I got my photo taken with one of the dancers:</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/the-feeling-concert/" itemprop="url">The Feeling Concert</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Went along to The Feeling Concert last night at the Music Hall, had a great time, they put on a really good show that had the whole crowd jumping.</p>

<p>They were supported by a very energetic Belgium band called <a href="http://www.daspop.com/">Das Pop</a>. A couple of their songs were catchy but they seemed like quite an odd group. One of the guitar players looked a bit like Grizzly Adams, and the lead singer as well as singing was trying to play the piano, the tambourine, and sing all at the same time, which seemed a bit strange.</p>

<p>The Feeling themselves were very good. Again, I hadn&rsquo;t had a chance to listen to their second album, so a couple of the songs I didn&rsquo;t recognise, but most of them I did. At one point Dan Gillespie jumps into the outstretched arms of the audience and crowd surfed his way along to his awaiting minder, and then went to the upstairs balcony to perform a solo instrumental song. Very well done!!!</p>

<p>This was the second time that I have seen The Feeling, and would definitely go back and see them again.</p>

<p>I took some photos, and you can see them below:</p>
