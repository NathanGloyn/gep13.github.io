	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>A few months back I <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=251">blogged</a> about how I was using a custom application on my Windows Phone 7 to control the wireless antenna in my ADSL router.  This was required because if the antenna was on while we were trying to watch Sky television upstairs via a wireless media sender, we would get interference on the screen upstairs.</p>

<p>I am happy to report that my custom Windows Phone 7 application can now be retired, as I now have a new, more complicated system <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" />.  Well, only slightly more complicated.  Bear with me while I try to explain it.</p>

<p>While we were getting the house decorated a couple months back I took the opportunity to run some Ethernet cable between a cupboard in our living room downstairs, upstairs to both the master bedroom, and the spare room (which is essentially the office).  I would have preferred that this Ethernet cable were CAT-6, however, the contractor that I hired only had CAT-5e (and it needed to be done that day as the decorator was then going to fill up the holes), more on this later.</p>

<p>I opted to have two individual Ethernet cables run between the cupboard and the master bedroom, and one between the cupboard and the office. (All of these cables are routed via the loft)</p>

<p>Now to explain, in the cupboard in the living room I have all the media devices that we use, this includes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Sky+ HD box</p></li>
<li><p>PS3</p></li>
<li><p>Wii</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The single cable is used to provide a wired connection between the PS3 and my <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=51">Synology Server</a> for streaming media down onto the downstairs TV.</p>

<p>The two cables running to the master bedroom were to be used to stream HD content from either the PS3 or the Sky+ HD box to the television upstairs.  The reason that I routed two cables was because originally I was going to use the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B002ECYEYA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B002ECYEYA">Neet - HDMI Extender</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B002ECYEYA" alt="" /> which required two dedicated cables to transmit the HD signal.</p>

<p>However, then I stumbled onto a similar device that claimed to be able to do the same job, but only use a single Ethernet cable!  This opened up the possibility of transmitting an HD signal from both the PS3 AND the Sky+ HD box, without the need to manually move cables around, or use some form of HD switching device.</p>

<p>I was intrigued!  My only concern was that I was using Cat-5e cable rather than Cat-6, and I was worried that I wouldn’t get as good a picture.  The decided that the only way to know for sure was to try it, and with that in mind I ordered the following kit.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001CYJQYO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B001CYJQYO">Climax Digital 2 Way HDMI Splitter</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001CYJQYO/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B001CYJQYO"><img src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.co.uk/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;Format=_SL110_&amp;ASIN=B001CYJQYO&amp;MarketPlace=GB&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822" alt="" /></a></p>

<p><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B001CYJQYO" alt="" /></p>

<p>I needed two of these.  This would be used to split the single signal from both the PS3 and the Sky+ HD box.  One would go directly into the TV downstairs, and the other would be routed via the HDMI Extender to the television upstairs.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B003YSW66Q/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B003YSW66Q">HDMI Extender over Single Cat5e</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B003YSW66Q" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B003YSW66Q/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B003YSW66Q"><img src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.co.uk/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;Format=_SL110_&amp;ASIN=B003YSW66Q&amp;MarketPlace=GB&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I needed two of these.  This would be used to take the second signal from the HDMI Splitter and do the magic of encoding the HD signal in such a way that it could be transmitted over Ethernet cable.  This device has two components, a sender and a receiver.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0017RW94A/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B0017RW94A">HDMI to HDMI Gold Plated Connectors</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B0017RW94A" alt="" /></p>

<p>I ended up buying a bunch of these.  You need one between the device and the splitter.  Two from the splitter, one to TV downstairs and one to the sender portion of the HDMI extender.  And one more between the receiver portion of the HDMI extender and TV upstairs.  Repeat for second device</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000OV0CEY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B000OV0CEY">10 Way 2 Metre surge Tower Extension Lead Socket</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B000OV0CEY" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000OV0CEY/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B000OV0CEY"><img src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.co.uk/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;Format=_SL110_&amp;ASIN=B000OV0CEY&amp;MarketPlace=GB&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Given the number of extra devices that I was putting into the cupboard I required some extra sockets in order to power them.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001RPWPQE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B001RPWPQE">Fisual Chunky Velcro Cable Ties - 10 Pack</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B001RPWPQE" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001RPWPQE/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B001RPWPQE"><img src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.co.uk/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;Format=_SL110_&amp;ASIN=B001RPWPQE&amp;MarketPlace=GB&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>In order to keep things tidy, well at least reasonable tidy, I used two packs of these to collect all the various cables together.</p>

<p>With all of the above in place and wired up, it was time for the moment of truth, was it all going to work….</p>

<p>The answer is yes!!</p>

<p>The picture and sound quality from both devices is exceptional.  I believe that you would be hard pushed to tell that either device was not directly plugged into the back of the upstairs TV.  In order to change between the Sky+ HD and the PS3 all that is required (on either TV) is to switch from one HDMI input to the other.</p>

<p>But, aha, the eagle eyed amongst you out there will still be wondering how I change the channel on the Sky+ HD box, or control the PS3 from upstairs.  Well, let me tell you…</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B003H4BVEK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B003H4BVEK">Remote Control Extender</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B003H4BVEK" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B003H4BVEK/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B003H4BVEK"><img src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.co.uk/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;Format=_SL110_&amp;ASIN=B003H4BVEK&amp;MarketPlace=GB&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822" alt="" /></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B003H4BVEK" alt="" /></p>

<p>This rather fetching device is used to take the Infra-Red signal from the Sky+ Remote Control and transmit it downstairs to the actual device.  Initially, we had some issues with alignment of this device in order to ensure that it worked, but once set up, it works perfectly.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B000OV0CEY" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000MWQTLU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B000MWQTLU">Sony Blu-Ray Disc Remote Control</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B000MWQTLU" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000MWQTLU/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B000MWQTLU"><img src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.co.uk/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;Format=_SL110_&amp;ASIN=B000MWQTLU&amp;MarketPlace=GB&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822" alt="" /></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B000MWQTLU" alt="" /></p>

<p>This uses Bluetooth to communicate with the PS3, so no need to repeat the signal, assuming that it is still in range.  I actually already owned one of these devices but I purchased a second one under the believe that I could use both at the same time.  However, this turns out to NOT be the case!  You can only have one Bluetooth Remote connected to the PS3 at once.  As a result, I use this device upstairs to control the PS3, and downstairs I use the standard PS3 controller.</p>

<p>And that, as they say, is that!</p>

<p>You could argue that the system is a “bit” complicated, and it could have been solved in other ways.  For instance, we could have set up Sky Multi-Room to allow us to watch Sky+ HD upstairs, and another PS3 could have been purchased and put upstairs.  However, both of these solutions would have meant additional hardware in the upstairs bedroom, and given the layout of the television, this would have been hard to achieve.  The above solution means that I can fully control all HD content from both the upstairs and downstairs TV.</p>

<p>Result!</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>In yesterdays <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=330">blog post</a> I mentioned how I was having some problems getting my shiny new 2 GB RAM for my ASUS 1015 PX working. I am happy to report that I now have it working!</p>

<p>Following a number of useful comments on the blog post, I set about trying a couple of things.</p>

<p>Firstly, I downloaded and installed <a href="http://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html">CPU-Z</a>, a freeware application that gathers information on some of the main devices on a system. This confirmed for sure that Windows 7 Starter was only seeing 1 GB of RAM.</p>

<p>The next plan of attack was to go into BIOS to make sure that there wasn’t something in there that had to be changed. But then came the inevitable question, which button gets you into BIOS? Is it F2? Is it Del? Is it Insert? After about 5 minutes of various different keyboard mashing and reboots, I was still unable to get into BIOS. A quick Google confirmed that there was no secret ASUS keyboard shortcut to get into BIOS, but I still couldn’t get into.</p>

<p>In a hopeless attempt, I decided to turn off the “Fast Boot” option (the option that allows me to choose between booting into Windows as normal or a Linux Distro). When I did this and rebooted the machine, the standard screen that says hit F2 to go into BIOS returned, hurrah!!</p>

<p>Once in there I still couldn’t see any options to change anything to do with Memory <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/wlEmoticon-sadsmile1.png" alt="Sad smile" /></p>

<p>Just as I was away to come out and try something else, I noticed on the main screen that the reported amount of RAM on the System was 2 GB! Weird!</p>

<p>So I decided to head back into Windows, on the off chance that simply going into BIOS (or turning the “Fast Boot” option off) had resulted in the full 2 GB of RAM was now being reported, and guess what…</p>

<p>It is!!!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/2_GB_RAM_Installed.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/2_GB_RAM_Installed_thumb.png" alt="2_GB_RAM_Installed" /></a></p>

<p>Now, part of me is curious as to what is going on here, so if anyone knows, I would be very interested to know, another part of me is just glad that it is working, and that I don’t have to go through the hassle of trying to return the RAM.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Following a comment on a recent <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=319">blog post</a>, I went on over to the Crucial website and confirmed that my NetBook was capable of handling 2 GB of RAM, and I was happy to find out that it could. I was even more happy to find out that it was only going to cost me £9.99, plus £2 for shipping bargain.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/58-2.jpg"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/58-2_thumb.jpg" alt="58 (2)" /></a></p>

<p>A couple days later, and I was the proud owner of a brand new stick of 2 GB of RAM.</p>

<p>The memory compartment for the ASUS 1015PX is located on the base of the NetBook, pictured on the left, and there is one simple screw keeping the compartment secure.</p>

<p>With this removed, I was able to expose the current 1GB of RAM that is installed on the NetBook, pictured below.<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/5a-2.jpg"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/5a-2_thumb.jpg" alt="5a (2)" /></a></p>

<p>To remove the currently installed RAM, it is a simple process of pushing the flexible piece of metal at each side of stick of RAM, and the RAM will pop up slightly out of secure holding.</p>

<p>With that done, you can simply lift the stick of RAM out of it holder.</p>

<p>Putting the new stick of RAM in is just as simple. Place the RAM into the opening of the secure holder, and gently push the top of the stick until the flexible piece of metal at each side snaps in to place.</p>

<p>The result of my efforts are pictured below.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/5b-2.jpg"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/5b-2_thumb.jpg" alt="5b (2)" /></a></p>

<p>With the new stick of RAM securely seated in the holder, the only thing left to do is to tighten the screw again, and the jobs done, all you have to do is boot back into Windows, and start enjoying your computers new found power!</p>

<p>However….</p>

<p>There would now appear to be a problem <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/wlEmoticon-sadsmile.png" alt="Sad smile" /></p>

<p>When I started up my NetBook, and booted back into Windows, I was greeted with the following when I went into the system properties:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/image.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/image_thumb.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>For some reason, the new stick of RAM has not been recognised, but the NetBook is functioning correctly?!?</p>

<p>Upon checking <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/system-requirements">here</a> I am now concerned that I need a 64 bit operating system in order to take advantage of the 2 GB of RAM. Can anyone confirm that this is the case?</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>It seems like ages since the last Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group meeting, but I am happy to say that our next event, scheduled for the 25th August, has now been confirmed.</p>

<p>We are lucky enough to have Jessica Meats of Microsoft doing a talk on SharePoint Online (Office 365) and the differences between it, and a full blown SharePoint server running in your environment.</p>

<p>Now, this time around we are going to try something a little different…</p>

<p>As I have mentioned at the last couple meetings, we are in the process of firming up the details on how we are going to make a move away from the Kentico CMS that we are currently using, in favour of some free services that can be used to organise events.</p>

<p>To that end, in order to register for this months event, you will have to head on over to <a href="http://adnuguk.eventbrite.com/">Eventbrite</a>, rather than the main Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group <a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/">website</a>. If you don’t have an Eventbrite account don’t worry, you can still register, using simply your first name, last name and email address. However, if you do sign up, which takes less than a minute, you will be able to easily register for future events.</p>

<p>I would greatly appreciate feedback on this decision. Do you like the idea? Do you think it is a terrible idea? Do you know of any other services that can be used? If you want to get in touch, feel free to either use the <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?page_id=38">contact form on this site</a>, or use the <a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Contact.aspx">contact form on the ADNUG site</a>.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/my-new-netbook/" itemprop="url">My New NetBook</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Last week I purchased my shiny new NetBook. I opted for the <a href="http://www.asus.com/Eee/Eee_PC/Eee_PC_1015PX/">ASUS Eee PC 1015PX</a> which you can see pictured below.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/56-2.jpg"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/56-2_thumb.jpg" alt="56 (2)" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/55-2.jpg"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/55-2_thumb.jpg" alt="55 (2)" /></a></p>

<p>The reason that I decided to get a NetBook is due to the amount of travelling that I have been doing lately. With each trip I was taking along my <a href="http://www.dell.com/us/p/studio-1558/pd">Dell Studio 1558</a>, which although not a massive laptop, does become rather cumbersome to move around after a while. In addition, when away on a trip I typically only used the laptop to check email, and write the odd blog post, so there really was no “need” to take the laptop, a NetBook would easily be able to do those things, plus a lot more.</p>

<p>I had a hard time deciding which NetBook I wanted to get, and I was toying with the idea of getting the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/NP-NC210-A03UK-Non-Gloss-Backlight-Graphics-Accelerator/dp/B004P9LGHI">Samsung NP-NC210</a> which has had a number of good reviews lately. However, when travelling through Birmingham Airport on my way back from the .Net Community Leaders Day I spotted this ASUS. I hadn’t looked specifically at this model (as it is a slightly older version), however, a quick Google determined that it to had reviewed a number of awards. Throw in the fact that it was on a “Managers Special” deal, I decided to get it.</p>

<p>So far, I have not been at all disappointed with the purchase, it does “exactly what it says on the tin”. I spent the weekend getting it set up, various applications, virus/spyware, etc, and so far it has eaten all of that up quite nicely. It also has the ability to dual boot into a Linux OS that basically has a web browser and a few other features, so assuming that all I want to do is surf the web, booting into this OS takes only a few seconds, which is quite a nice feature to have.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>While I was at <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=278">DDD South West</a> I had the pleasure of listening to a number of 20-20 presentations (20 slides, each one timed to last 20 seconds) and one that really stood out for me was <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/markrendle">Mark Rendle’s</a> “Kaizen For Coders”.</p>

<p>I have now had the chance to listen back to this presentation thanks for <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/guysmithferrier">Guy Smith-Ferrier</a>, who has downloads of four out of the six 20-20 presentations available on his <a href="http://guysmithferrier.com/post/2011/07/DDD-South-West-3-On-The-Day.aspx">blog</a>. I would highly encourage everyone to take 6 minutes and 40 seconds out of their day to watch this presentation.</p>

<p><em>NOTE: For those who are easily offended, there is one section where Mark let’s out a swear word.</em></p>

<p>In this presentation, Mark summarises a number of things that developers can be doing to improve themselves, some of which I was already doing, but others that I wasn’t, and it has made me stop and think about how I can improve myself as a developer.</p>

<p>Some of the main points of the presentation were:</p>

<blockquote>  
> 
>    
> 
> “Learn something new every day”
> 
>    
> 
> </blockquote>


<p>I am finding that I am doing this more and more now. Now, this might sound a little bit weird, but it’s true. I have been developing in .Net for around 8 years now, and it is only lately that I feel I am truly, regularly, learning new things. I don’t know if this is as a result of my increased involvement in the .Net Community, or whether data is simply more readily available, through mediums such as Twitter, but it is happening. It is all too easy to become complacent about things, but going out of your way to learn new things is a great way to inject some life back into your development.</p>

<blockquote>  
> 
>    
> 
> “Always, always be learning a new language”
> 
>    
> 
> </blockquote>


<p>Now this is something that I don’t do, but something that I am looking to change. I guess you could say that I am “stuck in a rut” in this regard. During my time as a .Net Developer I have done both Windows and Web Development, using both VB.Net and C#, and over the years I have picked up other things like SharePoint and Silverlight, but predominantly, this has all been using C#. In order to become a more “rounded” developer it is clear to me now that I have to start learning other languages and frameworks. The problem that I now face is deciding on which ones, as there are quite a lot out there!</p>

<blockquote>  
> 
>    
> 
> “Possibly the most important part of this entire presentation, read books!”
> 
>    
> 
> </blockquote>


<p>My work colleagues will testify to the fact that I have this one covered! I own a lot of books, and since purchasing my <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=93">Kindle</a>, I now own a few more. The problem here, as Mark points out, is that it is not enough just to own books, you also have to read them to. For a while there I was guilty of doing that, buying a book and never reading it, but I have learnt the error of my ways.</p>

<blockquote>  
> 
>    
> 
> “Listen to podcasts”
> 
>    
> 
> </blockquote>


<p>Again, this is something that I haven’t done a lot of, but I have now started listening to a few on the commute to work. At the minute, this consists of the likes of <a href="http://thisdeveloperslife.com/">This Developer’s Life</a>, <a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/">Hanselminutes</a>, and <a href="http://wpdevpodcast.com/">Windows Phone Dev Podcast</a>. Since I am new to this podcast “thing” I would welcome any additional recommendations.</p>

<blockquote>  
> 
>    
> 
> “Read code”
> 
>    
> 
> </blockquote>


<p>This is also not something that I have done a lot of. When I was first getting into ASP.Net development I used the original <a href="http://thebeerhouse.codeplex.com/releases/view/127">BeerHouse sample kit</a> for ASP.Net 2.0 which I still believe to be a great example of N-Tier application development, however, since then, I haven’t really “read” any other code samples. Again, this is something that I aim to change going forward. With open source repositories such as GitHub and BitBucket, there is plenty of code out there to take a look at.</p>

<blockquote>  
> 
>    
> 
> “Be prepared to invest some money in this process… you are a commodity, and you need to make sure that you maintain yourself as a commodity”
> 
>    
> 
> </blockquote>


<p>For me, this was the defining point of the presentation, and one that really resounded with me. Now obviously it isn’t always possible to fork out loads of money to keep up to date with the latest technologies, however, I think it is fair to say that you need to invest something; be it time or money.</p>

<p>This could be the travelling costs to get to free conferences such as those from DDD, or something simpler like getting involved in your local .Net User Group, you need to do it.</p>

<p>With this in mind, I have now made the decision to attend the <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event/open-source-dot-net/progressive-dot-net-tutorials-2011">Progressive .Net Tutorials</a> in London in September. I have never attended anything like this, but I was very intrigued by the offer of 4-hour in depth tutorials, and having looked at the session list, I decided that it was too good an opportunity to miss!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Hot on the heels of the <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=310">announcement</a> from #DDDNorth that they are accepting submissions from potential speakers, I have just found out the #DDDBelfast are doing the same <a href="http://www.developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/dddie11/">thing</a>.</p>

<p>This conference is set to take place on Saturday 1st October 2011 at the University of Ulster.</p>

<p>For the same reason that I will not be able to attend #DDDNorth, I will also not be able to attend #DDDBelfast, which is a great shame as I would have loved to attend.</p>

<p>October is shaping up to be a very busy month for conferences/events:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Saturday 1st October: DDD Belfast</p></li>
<li><p>Saturday 8th October: DDD North</p></li>
<li><p>Friday 21st to Sunday 23rd October: GiveCamp UK
Throw into the mix the fact that the <a href="http://www.buildwindows.com">Microsoft BUILD conference</a> is going to be held on Tuesday 12th September and you can see that there is a lot of stuff happening in the near future <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/wlEmoticon-smile1.png" alt="Smile" />  As someone who likes to try to attend all conferences and events in order to learn as much as I possibly can, I do think that 3 events back to back in October might be a little bit too much. It might perhaps be better to space these out so that there is only 1 per month, but at the same time, given that these events are put on free for the community, we really can’t complain too much.</p></li>

		<p>In case you hadn’t heard the DDD Conference, which this year has visited <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=28">Reading</a>, <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=210">Glasgow</a> and <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=278">Bristol</a>, is now coming to <a href="http://www.developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/north/Default.aspx">Sunderland</a>. This is going to take place on Saturday 8th October 2011, at the University of Sunderland.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I am not going to be able to make it to this event, I have already committed to going to <a href="http://www.givecamp.org.uk/">GiveCamp UK</a> later in October, and I can’t make both. However, if it is anything like the other DDD Conferences then I would highly recommend that you go along!!</p>

<p>Registration for the event is not open yet, however, they are accepting submissions for speakers on the day, so if you have a topic that you want to talk about, now is your chance to get a foot in the door.</p>

<p>To find out more information about the event check out the <a href="http://www.developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/north/Default.aspx">website</a> or you can follow <a href="http://twitter.com/dddnorth">@DDDNorth</a>, or you can use the #DDDNorth hash tag.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>This afternoon, while trying to find a sample that would help me create a Shell Extension for Windows Explorer, I stumbled across the All-In-One Code Framework on CodePlex:</p>

<p><a href="http://1code.codeplex.com/">http://1code.codeplex.com/</a></p>

<p>This is not something that I had heard of before, and the initial description of the project warranted some more investigation:</p>

<blockquote>  
> 
>    
> 
>     
>   * Are you frustrated by the lack of code samples for a certain programming task? 
>      
>   * Have you ever struggled to quickly get started with a technique? 
>      
>   * Have you expected someone to write code samples for you based on your requests for free? 
>      
>   * Is a one-stop code sample library for all Microsoft development technologies attractive to you?
>       
> 
> If your answer is YES to any of these questions, the Microsoft All-In-One Code Framework is for you!
> 
>    
> 
> </blockquote>


<p>After watching the introduction video <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Visual-Studio-Toolbox/Visual-Studio-Toolbox-All-In-One-Code-Framework">here</a>, I decided to get it installed.</p>

<p>There are two ways that you can use it, either as a <a href="http://1code.codeplex.com/releases/view/64539">standalone application</a> or as a <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/4934b087-e6cc-44dd-b992-a71f00a2a6df">Visual Studio 2010 Extension</a>. Due to the fact that the sample application is intended for use with the Express Editions of Visual Studio and because I am a hoarder of <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=3">Visual Studio Extensions</a>, I opted to install the Extension.</p>

<p>With this installed, you have two ways to access the available sample applications. The first is from the Tools Menu:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/All-In-Code-Framework_12560/All-In-One-Code-1.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/All-In-Code-Framework_12560/All-In-One-Code-1_thumb.png" alt="All In One Code 1" /></a></p>

<p>Clicking on this brings up this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/All-In-Code-Framework_12560/All-In-One-Code-3.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/All-In-Code-Framework_12560/All-In-One-Code-3_thumb.png" alt="All In One Code 3" /></a></p>

<p>Where you have the option to filter on keyword, language and technology.</p>

<p>The second method is to highlight a keyword within your code file and filter on that:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/All-In-Code-Framework_12560/All-In-One-Code-2.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/All-In-Code-Framework_12560/All-In-One-Code-2_thumb.png" alt="All In One Code 2" /></a></p>

<p>There are currently 678 sample applications that span a very wide area. The people behind this strive to create each sample using C#, VB.Net and C++, as well as for Visual Studio 2008 and Visual Studio 2010, so you should always be able to find sample in the language that you require. If you can’t, there is also the option to request a particular <a href="http://1code.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Request%20Code%20Sample%20from%20Microsoft%20All-In-One%20Code%20Framework&amp;referringTitle=Documentation">code sample</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have specified the location that you want to store the downloaded sample applications:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/All-In-Code-Framework_12560/image.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/All-In-Code-Framework_12560/image_thumb.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>You have the option to either download the sample applications as and when you require them, or you can download them all at once. Also, if an update to an application is published to the CodePlex site, the application notifies you of this, and gives you the option to upgrade.</p>

<p>All in all, I think that this is going to be a useful resource, and I would encourage you to take a look. Part of becoming a better programmer involves reading other peoples code, and this application gives you access to lots of it.</p>
