	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/microsoft-lync-2010-for-windows-phone-wont-connect-to-office-365/" itemprop="url">Microsoft Lync 2010 for Windows Phone – Won’t Connect to Office 365</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/clip_image002.jpg"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/clip_image002_thumb.jpg" alt="clip_image002" /></a></p>

<p>This morning, thanks to the medium of Twitter I found out that the Lync 2010 Client for Windows Phone had been released. A quick search on the Marketplace, and the application was downloading onto my Phone.</p>

<p>I immediately went and typed in the credentials for my Office 365 account expecting that it would just work, however, it came back with an error saying that it was “Unable to Sign In” and that I should check my sign in details, and server etc.</p>

<p>The first thing I checked was that Lync was still connecting fine from my desktop application, and it was. The second thing I tried was to manually type in the server name (or what I thought was the server name) into the necessary places, however, this didn’t work either.</p>

<p>After a bit of googling/binging, I found this:</p>

<p><a href="http://community.office365.com/en-us/w/lync/1040.aspx">http://community.office365.com/en-us/w/lync/1040.aspx</a></p>

<p>Which suggested that I needed to add another CNAME record to my DNS configuration in order for the Windows Phone application to work correctly. However, as per this <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=260">blog post</a> I believed that I had already setup the required DNS Settings. Time to investigate…</p>

<p><strong><em>NOTE: What follows is only required is your are managing your own DNS entries for your Office 365 Domain.</em></strong></p>

<p>After logging into my Office 365 account, I selected:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Home</p></li>
<li><p>Admin</p></li>
<li><p>Management | Domains</p></li>
<li><p>Selected the domain of interest, and then click “Manage DNS”</p></li>
</ul>


<p>And sure enough, the required DNS Records for Office 365 had changed since I last looked at it:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/clip_image0024.jpg"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/clip_image0024_thumb.jpg" alt="clip_image002[4]" /></a></p>

<p>There is a new CNAME entry for lyncdiscover.gep13.co.uk. And actually, the requirement for the second SRV record has been removed, replaced with another CNAME record.</p>

<p>I then set about making the required changes with my domain registrar, and after the required propagation time, I am happy to report that I am now able to connect my Windows Phone running Lync 2010 to my Office 365 account.</p>

<p>It would be nice to know if there were notifications about the changes to the DNS requirements for Office 365. If anyone knows where I can get these, I would be very interested to hear about it!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>For the last three months, the about of spam comments that I have been getting on my blog has been steadily increasing, as you can see here.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image7.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image_thumb.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>I use the wonderful <a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a> system to prevent the comments ever appearing on the actual blog post, so that isn’t really a problem, it is just the hassle of having to go and tidy them up!</p>

<p>I have what I would class as a low traffic blog, but I can only imagine how many spam comments other people have to deal with.</p>

<p>How many spam comments do you get?  What methods do you use to stop them?</p>

<p>Any advice would be gratefully received!</p>

<p>EDIT: I have just added Disqus to my blog.  Let&rsquo;s see if that makes any difference.</p>

<p>For those of you who don’t know me, I am a bit of a hoarder when it comes to Windows Phone applications. You can find a list of the ones that I currently have installed <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=305">here</a>.</p>

<p>Now, although I have lots of apps, I tend to go through them every so often and uninstall the ones that I haven’t used, or don’t plan on using.</p>

<p>While I was doing this today, I noticed that I pretty much have a full house of applications in terms of the first letter of the name. As shown in the screenshot opposite.</p>

<p>Being the geek that I am, I am now on a mission, to find a useful, and I stress useful, application, such that I can indeed have a full house!</p>

<p>So, over to you…</p>

<p>Are there any Windows Phone 7 applications that you think would be useful to me, that could help me complete my set?</p>

<p>All ideas welcome!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I am happy to say that I am now the proud owner of a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001V7RF9U/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B001V7RF9U">LEGO Mindstorms NXT 2.0 8547</a> set.  I <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=428">blogged</a> about this set last month, when I was suggesting that it would make an ideal Christmas present for a geek, however, after getting some Amazon vouchers for my birthday, I decided to go ahead and order it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/WP_000268.jpg"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/WP_000268_thumb.jpg" alt="WP_000268" /></a></p>

<p>I haven’t had much of a chance to play with it tonight, had a few other things on the go, but I will definitely be playing with this over the Christmas break, and I am really looking forward to it!</p>

<p>With the help of a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1593272162/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=1593272162">book</a> that I also got for my birthday (thanks Andy!), one of the first things that I will be building is a Rubik Cube Solver.  I have seen lots of videos of this on YouTube, and I honestly think that it is amazing what you can do.</p>

<p>If you haven’t seen this in action, take a look at the video below:</p>

<p>This particular example is not the quickest or smoothest solver of Rubik Cubes, however, it is built with the LEGO pieces that comes with the set that I have, so for that reason, it is as good a place to start as any!</p>

<p>If you are interested in the unboxing and contents of the 8547 set, you can take a look at the photos below.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>This morning, I switched on my phone, and it told me that there was an update available. It has only been a couple weeks since the <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=452">last update</a>, which provided me with the must needed ability to tether my phone to my laptop.</p>

<p>On plugging in my phone, and opening up Zune, I was presented with this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/2011-12-03_0939.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/2011-12-03_0939_thumb.png" alt="2011-12-03_0939" /></a></p>

<p>So this update was the one that I thought the last one was, a bug fix update <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" />.</p>

<p>This wasn’t a big update, and after about fifteen minutes, I got the following:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/2011-12-03_0956.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/2011-12-03_0956_thumb.png" alt="2011-12-03_0956" /></a></p>

<p>Simples!</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/time-tracking-software/" itemprop="url">Time Tracking Software</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>A few weeks ago I put out a <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/gep13/status/130396530136981505">tweet</a> asking for recommendations for a piece of software for time tracking:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/gep13/status/130396530136981505"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>What I got back was a wealth of options, including:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.timesnapper.com/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image1.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.yast.com/timetracker/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image2.png" alt="image" /></a><a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image3.png" alt="image" /></a><a href="http://www.yanomo.com/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image4.png" alt="image" /></a><a href="http://www.paymo.biz/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image5.png" alt="image" /></a><a href="http://www.fanuriotimetracking.com/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image6.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>My requirements for this are quite simple. The piece of software needed to be:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Simple and non-intrusive to use</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>If it is overly complicated to use, or takes a long time to do anything with it, it defies the point what I am trying to achieve</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>It has to be free</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I am doing this as an experiment to track various different tasks, and at the minute, I don’t want to have to fork out money. That doesn’t mean that at some point I wouldn’t transition to a paid service</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>It has to be able to provide a report on the time I have spent</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>In order to be useful, I need to be able to produce reports (in preferably multiple formats) of all the hours that I have worked on a task. Preferably, this would be selectable which regard to which projects to add to the report, which days to report on, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Usable from my mobile</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>It would be good to be able to start and stop timing while on the move and not on my main machine, so having a mobile phone application would be a bonus.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Having looked at the above suggestions, it was clear that it was going to be hard to pick which one to go with. Some I ruled out straight away, based on price and features, others I actually played with before making the final decision.</p>

<p>After a couple days playing around, I decided to give <a href="http://www.yast.com/timetracker/">Yast</a> a full trial run, and I am happy to say that I am not disappointed! Yast is fully web based, there is nothing to install on your machine, a big bonus in a corporate environment.</p>

<p>Its interface is ridiculously easy to use (you can see a live demo on their home page), and it’s reporting capabilities are very good. You have the ability to report in CSV, Excel and PDF.</p>

<p>Unlike some of the other packages which track the applications that you are currently using on you computer and automatically creates time entries for you, Yast relies on you starting and stopping a timer, per task. However, I don’t mind this. I simply keep a web browser open with the Yast page open, and when I need to change task, I simply jump to the web browser, and make the switch. This is actually a useful thing, because when people come up to ask questions, I make a conscious effort to make sure that they see me stopping and starting a timer, that way they know that they are accruing time, that will ultimately get billed to their project. Even if I forget to do this, the editing mechanism is, again, incredibly simple to use.</p>

<p>Yast also comes with <a href="http://m.yast.com">http://m.yast.com</a>, which works perfectly from my Windows Phone 7, so when I am out and about, I can track my time as well.</p>

<p>All in all, I am very happy with using Yast, so much so that I am using the reports that it produces to provide information to my line manager about what I have been working on. I would very much recommend you take a look at this package if you are looking for help tracking your time.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>With one thing and another (mainly work), I have not been keeping up with news about my beloved HTC HD7, running Windows Phone 7.  So last Friday when a message popped up on my phone to say that there was an update available for it, I was a bit surprised.  I turned to Twitter to ask a question about what the update was for (ok, I was being lazy), and the answer that I got back was it was a <a href="http://www.winrumors.com/microsoft-rolling-out-windows-phone-update-to-fix-exchange-and-voicemail-bugs/">bug fix release for Exchange and Voicemail</a>.</p>

<p>Nothing in the information that I then read about made me want to run away and install it there and then, so I decided to leave it until I had more time.</p>

<p>The next day came and I saw this tweet from ShawnWildermuth:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ShawnWildermuth/status/137623103256793088"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/image1.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>I couldn’t quite believe what I was reading!  This was the killer function that I have been waiting for!  Ever since switching to Windows Phone 7 from my Windows Mobile 6.5 I have sorely missed the ability to fire up the internet on my laptop while on the move.  A quick conversation exchange with Shawn pointed me <a href="http://www.wpcentral.com/updates-out-htc-hd7-mozart-and-samsung-focus-bringing-tethering-many">here</a>, and I set about starting the update!</p>

<p>The good news?  I can now tether my laptop to the internet via my Windows Phone 7!! <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/wlEmoticon-smile1.png" alt="Smile" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMAG0354.jpg"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMAG0354_thumb.jpg" alt="IMAG0354" /></a></p>

<p>With the update installed, you will see a new “Internet Sharing” option in the Settings window.  Then all that is left to do is to enable it.  With that done, you will have the option to connect up to 5 devices to the internet via your handset.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMAG0352.jpg"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMAG0352_thumb.jpg" alt="IMAG0352" /></a></p>

<p>The only thing that worries me now is the reports that I have been hearing on the news about unlimited data contracts, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2011/nov/22/mobile-web-users-unlimited-data-caps">not actually being unlimited</a>.  Before I start using this service heavily I am going to check with my service provider that I actually do have an unlimited data contract, and I would strongly advice that you do the same before using this service, as the last thing that you are going to want is a hefty mobile phone bill at the end of the month.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/a-review-of-dunddd/" itemprop="url">A Review of #DunDDD</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>The <a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/home/">DDD</a> series of conferences in the UK is growing!  Firstly, with a new conference in Sunderland called <a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/north/">DDDNorth</a>.  Unfortunately, I was not able to attend that one this year, however, I was able to attend the other new conference; namely <a href="http://dundee.dddscotland.co.uk/">DunDDD</a>.</p>

<h2>DunDDD</h2>

<p>Brought to you by the people who organised the <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=99">NoSQL Autumn Conference</a> in Dundee last year and <a href="http://scottishdevelopers.com/">Scottish Developers</a>, this event was a three track event, with five sessions spread over the course of the day.  The first track was dedicated to “NoSQL”, the second was “The Web” and the third was a general track.</p>

<p>At the start of the day, Colin MacKay asked if I would manage to help out as a room monitor which I agreed to, which resulted in me spending most of the day in the General Track, however, the majority of the sessions that I wanted to see were in this track, so that worked out quite well.</p>

<h2>Session 1</h2>

<p><a href="http://dddscotland.co.uk/lineup/speaker/11">Data Mining The Social Web</a> – Gary Short (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/garyshort">@garyshort</a>)</p>

<p>First up, I decided to attend Gary Short’s session.  I have had the opportunity to see this talk on a number of occasions, at a few different conferences, but due to clashes with other sessions that I also wanted to see, I have never been able to attend.  I thought it was about time that I fixed that, and I am happy to say that I was not disappointed.</p>

<p>Gary presented a very clear picture of how analysing information from Social Media sites such as Twitter and Facebook, can provide some very useful and pertinent information for marketing purposes within your business.</p>

<p>For instance, you can use data analysis techniques to find out information like:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>_“When Do My Customers Talk About Me?” _</p></li>
<li><p>_“How Fast Do They Start To Talk About Me?” _</p></li>
<li><p>_“What’s My Share of The Buzz?” _</p></li>
<li><p>_“When Is The Busiest Hour&#8221;?” _</p></li>
<li><p>_“What Words Do They Use?” _</p></li>
<li><p>_“Who Are The Influencers” _</p></li>
<li><p>_“Most ReTweets” _</p></li>
<li><p><em>“What is The Lexical Diversity?”</em></p></li>
</ul>


<p>With this information at hand, companies can then decide on a social marketing campaign to make decisions about when is the best time to make a tweet about your product and also which words to use.  Unfortunately, Gary ran a little short of time and was not able to show the sample code that he uses to produce the analyses.  I am hoping that Gary will make this information available, and if he does, I will link back to it from here.</p>

</ul>


<h2>Session 2</h2>

<p><a href="http://dddscotland.co.uk/lineup/speaker/4">The Philosophy of Unix</a> – Craig Nicol (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/craignicol">@craignicol</a>)</p>

<p>There was a slight change of title for this presentation before it kicked off.  It was changed to:</p>

<p>“The Philosophy of Code”</p>

<p>This was actually a very well put together presentation!  Using a number of quotes from various people throughout history (you can see a full list of quotes below) Craig was able to establish some “rules” that can be applied to your day to day development work.</p>

<p>The one thing that I would say is, this presentation could do with some “polish”.  After speaking afterwards, this was the first time that Craig had done this talk, and with some additional practice I think this could turn into a fantastic session that is a must see!</p>

<h2>Session 3</h2>

<p><a href="http://dddscotland.co.uk/lineup/speaker/5">“The Happy Developer” – Is It a Myth?</a> – Andy Gibson (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ARGibson">@ARGibson</a>)</p>

<p>This session led on very nicely from Craig’s session and attempted to answer the eternal question… “<em>What makes a happy developer?</em>”  It is reasonably simply to answer the opposite question, “<em>What makes a developer unhappy?</em>”, in fact, Andy asked this question to the members of the audience, and this is what we came up with:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Have to work on Sundays</p></li>
<li><p>When you ship crap</p></li>
<li><p>Bad specifications</p></li>
<li><p>No specifications</p></li>
<li><p>No change controls</p></li>
<li><p>When Managers don’t respect your schedule</p></li>
</ul>


<p>However, what makes us happy?  This lead into a reasonably heated discussion into whether it is our environment, our co-workers, our equipment, our responsibilities, or a combination of all these things that make us happy in our job.  This was the third time that Andy has given this presentation, and you can see how the talk is maturing, and I am sure that there will be some take away points from this conference that will make it into his next presentation.
During the talk, Andy also asked another question, “<em>What does a developer in 2011 need?</em>”, this is what the room came up with:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Peace</p></li>
<li><p>At least two large monitors</p></li>
<li><p>A desk with drawers</p></li>
<li><p>No phones (distraction)</p></li>
<li><p>Comfortable chair</p></li>
<li><p>Donuts</p></li>
<li><p>Program Specification</p></li>
<li><p>Good Development Tools</p></li>
<li><p>Testers</p></li>
<li><p>Creative Outlet</p></li>
<li><p>Problem solving tools (whiteboards, post it notes, etc.)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>For me, a couple of take away points were:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Record your estimates.  Even if you don’t have a formal process, record them for your own records.  That way, when you have to estimate something else, you can look at this estimate, compare it against how long it actually took, and that way you will make a better estimate.</p></li>
<li><p>What it boils down to is… Respect.  Respect is earned in both directions. Much the same as trust.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Lunch and Grok Talks</h2>

<p>Hmmm…. Pizza!! This was kindly donated by NCR (one of the sponsors of DunDDD).  Although the agenda mentioned that there would be some Grok Talks, I ended up in a conversation with <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/camurphy">@CAMURPHY</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/argibson">@ARGibson</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/leggetter">@leggetter</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/craignicol">@craignicol</a>, so I couldn’t actually tell you if there were any Grok Talks.  It was a very interesting conversation though <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" /></p>

<h2>Session 4</h2>

<p>Open Discussion on Software Requirements – Craig Murphy and Craig Nicol (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/camurphy">@CAMURPHY</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/craignicol">@craignicol</a>)</p>

<p>What Makes Good Requirements?  This was the question that the two Craig’s (they reminded me of the two Ronnie’s) were trying to answer in this open discussion.  The reason for this discussion was that Craig Murphy is actually going to be doing a talk at the <a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/">Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group</a> in December, and this session was to act as Market Research to find out what sort of problems other people have run into when trying to establish requirements for a project.</p>

<p>This was a very lively session, with lots of good discussion.  There were not a lot of people in attendance, but I think that helped the flow of the conversation, and the end result was a lot of food for thought!  I am now very interested to hear Craig’s session in December.</p>

<p>During the presentation Craig Nicol was creating an XMind Document of all the points, which you can find on his <a href="http://craignicol.wordpress.com/2011/11/20/slides-and-mind-maps-for-dunddd/">blog</a>, so if you are interested, you can go and grab it.</p>

<h2>Session 5</h2>

<p><a href="http://dddscotland.co.uk/lineup/speaker/6">Jedi Mind Control 101</a> – Rob Lally (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/roblally">@roblally</a>)</p>

<p>I had never had the opportunity to see Rob do a presentation before today, but I have to say that I was very impressed.  He is a great speaker, and the subject matter did drive home a few important points about when you are interacting with colleagues, managers etc.</p>

<p>Although the title seems a bit cryptic, this session is well worth attending, and I would thoroughly recommend attending if it comes up at another conference.</p>

<p>For me, some of the take away points were as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In terms of trying to interact with your colleagues and managers, bottom line is, “<em>Nothing works if you’re a ^*”£%$</em>”.  This seems fairly obvious, but it is also something that is easy forgotten in the middle of a discussion/argument.</p></li>
<li><p>Within your team, you need to get into a cycle of positive feedback, and not negative feedback.</p></li>
<li><p>“<em>Teams gel when they lose track of favours</em>” – better when everyone (either across a single team, or across teams within a company) is just willing to help each other out.</p></li>
<li><p><em>“Do Not Diminish Your Efforts”</em>.  Don’t say things like:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>All part of the job</p></li>
<li><p>No problem</p></li>
<li><p>It was nothing</p></li>
<li><p>It was easy</p></li>
<li><p>It was nothing</p></li>
<li><p>It was easy</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Instead, make it clear that you have helped the person and here are the reasons why, but also don&rsquo;t rub it in their face. Be concrete about what effort was expended, and verbalise that a favour was done.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>P.S. Sorry for messing up the timing queues at the end of your session Rob, don’t know what happened there.  All I can say was it had been a long day! <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" /></p>
