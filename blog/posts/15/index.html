	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>The following is a list of the applications that I currently have installed on my HTC HD7 running Windows Phone 7. This is not intended to be a comprehensive list of “essential” Windows Phone 7 Applications, but rather a list that I will use for my own purposes (as a gentle reminder of what I have installed in case something ever goes wrong) and which will likely change over time as more applications are found.</p>

<p>Feel free to let me know about any apps that you have that you think that I would benefit from, I always like to hear about new things!</p>

<p><em>NOTE: If you are interested in how I got the URL’s for the applications listed here, take a look at this blog post </em><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/mobile/find-id-of-windows-phone-7-app-and-create-direct-zune-marketplace-link/"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p><strong><strong>MarketPlace Applications</strong></strong></p>

<p><a href="http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&amp;id=16b4f331-e05b-e011-854c-00237de2db9e">…i’m a wp7!</a> – I have to admit, I haven’t done much with this particular app yet, but it does show a lot of promise. Perhaps, as more people start using it, it will become more useful.</p>

<p><a href="http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&amp;id=bc4f319a-9a9a-df11-a490-00237de2db9e">Adobe Reader</a> – Not an application that I use a lot, but very handy when trying to read the odd PDF on the phone</p>

<p><a href="http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&amp;id=23828a51-5391-e011-986b-78e7d1fa76f8">Allrecipes</a> – I am a terrible cook, but at least this will help me get all the ingredients needed for throwing something together.</p>

<p><a href="http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&amp;id=48195fb4-ee0e-e011-9264-00237de2db9e">Amazon Kindle</a> – Thanks to Amazon’s WhisperSync technology picking up your book from where you left off is just a joy</p>

<p><a href="http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&amp;id=28822e51-cf15-440c-b97a-2c1671986fa4">Another Level</a> – A very nicely put together app, that is VERY useful!</p>

<p><a href="http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&amp;id=576327f5-785c-4997-bc01-dc9fe4423f88">BabelCam</a> – Again, another app that I haven’t had to use yet, but I really like the idea of it.</p>

<p><a href="http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&amp;id=744d9d43-ee65-e011-81d2-78e7d1fa76f8">Bing Get Me There</a> – I used this on my last trip to London, and it is an absolute must!</p>

<p><a href="http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&amp;id=2f9d08aa-b17b-e011-986b-78e7d1fa76f8">British Airways</a> – This is an application that I use a lot, mainly because I don’t fly BA all the time, but it is a very nice sample application of what can be achieved.</p>

<p><a href="http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&amp;id=ddd1ad08-d9d5-df11-a844-00237de2db9e">Cocktail Flow</a> – Like the <a href="http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&amp;id=2f9d08aa-b17b-e011-986b-78e7d1fa76f8">British Airways</a> application, this is one I use as a reference application more than anything else</p>

<p><a href="http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&amp;id=dc5f12fa-b49d-e011-986b-78e7d1fa76f8">Currency</a> – Just one of those apps that you should have installed.</p>

<p><a href="http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&amp;id=03ad3d9b-c79d-e011-986b-78e7d1fa76f8">Dictionary.com</a> – Just one of those apps that you should have installed.</p>

<p><a href="http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&amp;id=b13f4051-2a57-e011-854c-00237de2db9e">Dude, WIMU</a> – When the Nodo update was running late, this application was very handy for checking on the status of the update. Let’s hope Mango isn’t going to be the same</p>

<p><a href="http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&amp;id=82a23635-5bd9-df11-a844-00237de2db9e">Facebook</a> – Typically I use the built in OS functionality for talking to Facebook, but there are some things that it can’t do, so being able to fall back to the full application is always handy.</p>

<p><a href="http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&amp;id=2e49fb07-592b-e011-854c-00237de2db9e">Flickr</a> – When nice application for looking at your photostream and your friends.</p>

<p><a href="http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&amp;id=cfd5a18e-1df8-df11-9264-00237de2db9e">Gifts</a> – With the run up to Christmas and birthdays, this provides the ability to track what presents you have bought and ideas for others.</p>

<p><a href="http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&amp;id=7b8bedd5-4368-e011-81d2-78e7d1fa76f8">gMaps</a> – Normally I default to the built in Maps application, however there have been times I have used this, for instance, when trying to get traffic updates.</p>

<p><a href="http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&amp;id=47878950-105f-e011-81d2-78e7d1fa76f8">Groupon</a> – Even though they are in trouble just now with the OFT, a handy app to have on the phone.</p>

<p><a href="http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&amp;id=b9cd6b7b-1be1-df11-a844-00237de2db9e">GuestList</a> – I have been playing with this app in order to track the attendees at the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group meetings. It doesn’t quite do everything that I want, so may be replaced with another Eventbrite application.</p>

<p><a href="http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&amp;id=5b5aa6e8-1af3-df11-9264-00237de2db9e">handyscan</a> – Does exactly what it says on the tin!</p>

<p><a href="http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&amp;id=f113744f-d700-e011-9264-00237de2db9e">Jingle Balls</a> – A very simple, yet addictive little application. Perfect for the holiday season.</p>

<p><a href="http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&amp;id=518ccdb1-c360-4cf0-a0f6-89b2890bda6e">IN+ Networking</a> – The LinkedIn integration on the WP7 isn’t perfect, and this fills the void.</p>

<p><a href="http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&amp;id=9b86eadc-16e8-df11-9264-00237de2db9e">LastPass</a> – I am currently “trialling” LastPass across my multiple computers, and having it on the phone is a bonus, also there are some websites that it just flat out doesn’t work with.</p>

<p><a href="http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&amp;id=21462e9b-4fe8-df11-9264-00237de2db9e">Love Clean Streets</a> – I really like the idea of this application although I have not yet had the occasion to use it.</p>

<p><a href="http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&amp;id=21baf298-210a-4fe1-9a89-6314ae62151f">Phonealytics</a> – A very good interface into your Google Analytics data.</p>

<p><a href="http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&amp;id=2f840483-0a54-e011-854c-00237de2db9e">Pocket C#</a> – A cracking example of what can be achieved by an application running on Windows Phone 7</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>On Thursday 7th July, the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group was lucky enough to welcome <a href="http://www.kodefuguru.com/">Chris Eargle</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/kodefuguru">@KodefuGuru</a>), a Telerik Developer Evangelist from Columbia, South Carolina, to do a talk entitled “<a href="http://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Meetings/Secrets-of-a--Net-Ninja.aspx">Secrets of a .Net Ninja</a>”.</p>

<p>Due to the format of this presentation, primarily focused around code demonstrations, there was only an introductory set of slides, so I have not posted them here.</p>

<p>However, all of the code (and much, much more) that Chris talked through on the night is available at his CodePlex Project which you can find <a href="http://kodefu.codeplex.com/">here</a>. I am in the process of downloading the latest version as I type <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" />.</p>

<p>There was no messing around in this talk, we jumped straight into talking about:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Private Member Inheritance</p></li>
<li><p>Removing the use of Out Parameters</p></li>
<li><p>Extension Method Refactoring</p></li>
<li><p>Advanced use of LINQ, Lambdas and Anonymous Methods
There was a lot of content in this presentation, and there was certainly a lot of food for thought. The sample code helps in cementing how these techniques can be used in your day-to-day programming activities.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Unfortunately I wasn’t able to go, but some of the guys took Chris to the <a href="http://www.brewdog.com/">BrewDog</a> bar for a round of <a href="http://www.brewdog.com/sink_the_bismark">Sink The Bismarck</a> after the meeting, I hope he doesn’t miss his flight back home to the states today!</p>

<p>Big thanks to Chris for taking time to visit the <a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Home.aspx">Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group</a>.</p>

<p>Don’t forget about our next event which is happening on the Thursday 21st July 2011. <a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/">Paul Stack</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/stack72">@stack72</a>), a Continuous Integration enthusiast, is travelling up to present his talk entitled “<a href="http://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Meetings/Beginners-Guide-to-CI.aspx">Beginners Guide to CI</a>”. I have seen this talk once before (although I know he has added some parts to it since I last saw it so interested to see what he has lined up) and I would encourage anyone who is interested in getting started with CI, or even if you are already using it, to come along.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>As some of you may have noticed, I have switched from using the #ADNUG hash tag to using #ADNUGUK on Twitter. This is due to the fact that there was a clash with the <a href="http://www.adnug.org/">Austin Dot Net User Group</a>, as well as the <a href="http://www.adnug.com/">Adelaide Dot Net User Group</a>, so if you are ever mentioning the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group can I ask you to use #ADNUGUK.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>One of the most essential tools for working on web development is Fiddler:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/">http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/</a></p>

<p>For those who don’t know:</p>

<blockquote>  
> 
>    
> 
> Fiddler is a Web Debugging Proxy which logs all HTTP(S) traffic between your computer and the Internet. Fiddler allows you to inspect all HTTP(S) traffic, set breakpoints, and &#8220;fiddle&#8221; with incoming or outgoing data. Fiddler includes a powerful event-based scripting subsystem, and can be extended using any .NET language.
> 
>    
> 
> </blockquote>


<p>This tool has helped me out in a number of situations, and it is actually one of the first things that I <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=198">install on my machine</a> if I ever need to rebuild it.</p>

<p>The other day when using Fiddler I was blown away by a feature that I had not seen before. Namely, the ability to filter HTTP traffic coming from a single process. The concept is by no means a new one, but it is the way in which Fiddler does it that I thought was very clever.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Steps</em></strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p> Open your web browser ready for inspecting traffic</p></li>
<li><p> Open Fiddler</p></li>
<li><p> Find the “Process Filter” toolbar item in the main toolbar</p></li>
</ol>


<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/image.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/image_thumb.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<ol>
<li> Hover your mouse hover this and you will see the following tooltip which pretty much explains it all. Click your mouse on the “Process Filter” button and the text will change to say “pick target…” and the icon will change to be a cross hair.</li>
</ol>


<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/image1.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/image_thumb1.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<ol>
<li><p> With the left mouse button still held down, move the mouse to the window (process) that you want to filter the HTTP target from. In this case, it is the web browser that you opened in step 1, but it could equally be any other application that is communicating over HTTP.</p></li>
<li><p> The “Process Filter” button will change again to show the process id that it is filtering HTTP traffic from</p></li>
</ol>


<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/image2.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/image_thumb2.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<ol>
<li> Once you are finished, simply left click the “Process Filter” toolbar item again and the filter will be removed.</li>
</ol>


<p>In my case, if I open Fiddler on my non development machine I have HTTP traffic coming from Windows Live Mesh, Outlook, OneNote, BookMark synchronisation, etc. Trying to figure out what is going on with one “thing” can be difficult, this filtering ability makes it very easy, and as I mentioned I think the way in which you select the process to filter on is VERY clever.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/very-much-looking-forward-to-givecampuk/" itemprop="url">Very Much Looking Forward to @GiveCampUK…</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>In case you haven’t heard about it, there is a very exciting event coming up on the weekend of the 21st October 2011. It’s called GiveCampUK:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.givecamp.org.uk/">http://www.givecamp.org.uk/</a></p>

<p>The idea behind this event, which was first started in Dallas, Texas, is that a bunch of like minded developers get together and help out a group of charities and non-profit organisations with their technology requirements. My understanding is that this could range from creating a website from scratch to deploying a WordPress Blog that they require for their site.</p>

<p>At present, the event has fulfilled it’s quota for required volunteers (developers, designers and database administrators), but if you are interested, you can still <a href="http://www.givecamp.org.uk/volunteer">sign up</a> to be on a shortlist in case some people have to drop out.</p>

<p>I am delighted to say that I have made it onto the list and I am very much looking forward to taking part in the event, although, having never done anything like this before, I have to admit that I am a little bit nervous. What makes it worse is that I know that there are a lot of VERY talented developers taking part in the event. This is great for the charities, as they will get the benefit of the wealth of their combined experience, but from a personal stand point, it does make it a little intimidating <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Looking-forward-to_1194B/wlEmoticon-sadsmile.png" alt="Sad smile" />.</p>

<p>However, I am determined to make this most of this experience, as I firmly believe that I will get as much out of this, as hopefully the charities will get from me. It is a great chance to socialise with and learn from other developers, and be exposed to technologies and processes that I might otherwise not have seen.</p>

<p>For more information on the event, you can find the organisers on Twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/givecampuk">@GiveCampUK</a>) and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/GiveCampUK">FaceBook</a>.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/can-net-user-groups-get-office365-for-free/" itemprop="url">Can .Net User Groups Get @Office365 for Free?</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>For a few months now I have been using the Office365 Beta to run the email accounts for the <a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/">Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group</a> and I am happy to say that it has been working really well, and in all honesty, it “just” works.</p>

<p>I have it hooked up through Outlook on my desktop as an Exchange Account, and also through my Windows Phone 7. Initially, there were a couple teething problems to get the <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=260">required DNS entries sorted out</a>, but that was more of a problem with my hosting provider than anything else.</p>

<p>As a User Group we are “toying” with the idea of perhaps using the supplied SharePoint Team Site to host the actual .Net User Group Website and fully utilise the built in Document Library functionality of SharePoint to share documents/slide decks with our users, as well as collaborate on User Group documents.</p>

<p>Now comes the problem though…</p>

<p>Since the Office365 program is now out of Beta, you now have to pay for the service. <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/wlEmoticon-sadsmile2.png" alt="Sad smile" /></p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, this is not a huge amount of money, it starts at £4 per user, per month (full details can be found <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/office365/online-software.aspx">here</a>), but given that we are a User Group who runs free events for the community, there simply isn’t any budget allocated for this type of service.</p>

<p>So, as an open question to Microsoft (are you there?) I would like to request that this service be provided free of charge to .Net User Groups across the country.</p>

<p>We (.Net User Groups) are investing a lot of time in energy in bringing events to our members and informing them about your technology stack so I think it would be a great idea if this service could be provided to help us continue to do this.</p>

<p>So…</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Last year I was struggling to think what I could get my dad for his Christmas. Every year it is the same problem, and normally the same sort of present gets bought, namely something to do with Golf. Don’t get me wrong, he loves his Golf, and he plays just about every weekend, so I don’t think he minds getting Golf related presents, but I always try to get him something different. In the past, this has ranged from “geek” related presents like a Bluetooth hands free kit for his car to Billy Connolly DVDs. However, this time I wanted to do something different, and after trawling the internet, I stumbled across this website:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.giftexperiencescotland.com/">http://www.giftexperiencescotland.com/</a></p>

<p>Which led me to <a href="http://www.giftexperiencescotland.com/driving-vouchers/offroad-driving-gift-voucher/extended-4x4-offroad-driving-experience-near-aberfeldy./product-detail-EXP139/">here</a>, which is provided by a company called <a href="http://www.highlandsafaris.net/leisure/">Highland Safaris</a>.</p>

<p>So I ended up buying him this on the understanding that I would be the “other” person that he would be taking along with him (I made sure that this was understood very early in the process <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/wlEmoticon-smile2.png" alt="Smile" />)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Photo_65094934-7CE5-2FDF-0208-CB9AB0984248.jpg"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Photo_65094934-7CE5-2FDF-0208-CB9AB0984248_thumb.jpg" alt="Photo_65094934-7CE5-2FDF-0208-CB9AB0984248" /></a>This last weekend (25th June), we travelled down to Dull, just west of Aberfeldy to the Highland Safaris Centre. For those of you who are interested, this is the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Highland+Safaris,+Aberfeldy,+United+Kingdom&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=56.618324,-3.934908&amp;spn=0.037213,0.077162&amp;sll=56.61719,-3.93744&amp;sspn=0.009304,0.01929&amp;geocode=CeGWL-mfSgx7FRLwXwMdV83D_ynxI6kX6aSISDE7st8IwrS1uw&amp;z=14">location</a>.</p>

<p>The Centre itself is very easy to find, and it has a small shop and Cafe. After checking in at reception we were told that our Instructor, Bob, would be ready in about 20 minutes, so we decided to grab some food at the Cafe and wait.</p>

<p>As promised, after 20 minutes or so we were ready to go. We were asked to stand in front of a map and told about the route that we were going to be taking, and what we were getting to do. However, there was no mention of us actually driving the land rover, and there also seemed to be more people coming along than I expected. I thought it was just my father and I. A quick word with the Instructor sorted everything out. Turns out there were two sets of “Park” checked in. One for a family highland safari (which had just been explained to us) and one for a 4x4 Driving Experience.<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Photo_BF421791-BEE1-66D7-6DAC-1CB53C39D1E9.jpg"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Photo_BF421791-BEE1-66D7-6DAC-1CB53C39D1E9_thumb.jpg" alt="Photo_BF421791-BEE1-66D7-6DAC-1CB53C39D1E9" /></a></p>

<p>With all that sorted out, we were introduced to the machine that we would be getting to drive. <em>Ain’t she a beaut?</em></p>

<p>After our Instructor drove us to the starting point we then each took turns in driving over various sections of terrain including muddy sections of road, through water, and some very steep down hill sections. In total, between the two of us, we had 2 and a half hours of driving, which I felt was very good value for money.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Photo_887318B5-1AD6-1509-14EC-9287D5B30A3E.jpg"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Photo_887318B5-1AD6-1509-14EC-9287D5B30A3E_thumb.jpg" alt="Photo_887318B5-1AD6-1509-14EC-9287D5B30A3E" /></a></p>

<p>Here is a photo of my dad driving through one of the sections of water. It wasn’t particularly deep, but still not something that you get to do in normal day to day driving.</p>

<p>Along the way we got to see some stunning views (see below), the countryside and wildlife around Aberfeldy is stunning, and I would recommend that anyone go there for a visit. At one of the highest points on the drive, called the “View Point” we stopped to have a quick dram of a local Whisky (Dewar’s White Label) and as we were standing having a chat we saw two buzzards flying around overhead, it really was quite impressive.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Photo_67E19F6B-E072-4BB1-9AB1-260F6FF1AD0F.jpg"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Photo_67E19F6B-E072-4BB1-9AB1-260F6FF1AD0F_thumb.jpg" alt="Photo_67E19F6B-E072-4BB1-9AB1-260F6FF1AD0F" /></a></p>

<p>For me, one of the most amazing parts of the day was the land rover itself. At one point while I was driving, I came up to a particularly steep section of track. The instructor then told me to put it into first gear, let it start to pull away, and then take both my feet off all the pedals, and just concentrate on steering. At first, I thought he was joking, but he was quite serious. In doing this, you then essentially let the engine take over, and it will control everything for you, allowing you to safely descend. This meant that it would maintain a constant speed and rate of descent by controlling the braking and acceleration. Now, you could argue that this takes some of the “fun” out of it, but if you had seen the steepness of the hill, I think you would have happily let the land rover take over as well!! It truly is an amazing piece of engineering.</p>

<p>All in all, it was a great day out, and I can wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone. Now the only problem it what to get Dad for Christmas this year!!</p>

<p>I <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=268">debated</a> for a long time as to whether I was actually going to attend this event, but in the end, I am very much glad that I did!</p>

<p>After seeing a Tweet from Guy asking for volunteers to help, I decided that I was going to offer my services. As a result, I ended up being a room monitor for the day. This involved ensuring that the speaker had everything that was required, as well as giving out and collecting the speaker feedback forms. I “think” this went ok, as I didn’t hear any complaints. I quite enjoyed doing this, and I will be volunteering my services going forward, especially if they continue to offer up the same free t-shirts <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/wlEmoticon-smile1.png" alt="Smile" /></p>

<p><strong>Getting there…</strong></p>

<p>As explained in my previous <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=268">blog post</a> I ended up getting a lift to Bristol from <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/CAMURPHY">@CAMURPHY</a> who was also giving a lift to <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/chriscanal">@chriscanal</a> (getting picked up in Edinburgh), <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/colinmackay">@colinmackay</a> (getting picked up in Glasgow) and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/apwestgarth">@apwestgarth</a> (getting picked up in Carlisle). This meant getting up at 0420 in order to be at the pick up point for 0800. All in all, it was a long day of driving (still not quite sure how Craig was able to do this, I know I couldn’t) to get there, but there was plenty of “geek” chat in the car to make it pass relatively quickly.</p>

<p><strong>Session 1 – Kanban? what is it and how can it help?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Presenter – </strong>Nathan Gloyn<strong> (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/NathanGloyn">@NathanGloyn</a>)</strong></p>

<p>My first session as a room monitor, woot!</p>

<p>I was particularly looking forward to this talk, as I really do believe that Kanban is a useful approach, and I am certainly going to be using it in my next “pet” project, whenever I get the time to get started. Having attended Chris McDermott <a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/scotland2011/ViewSession.aspx?SessionID=688">“Introduction to Kanban”</a> at DDD Scotland, I was familiar with the basics of Kanban, but I was interested to hear Nathan’s take on it.</p>

<p>I very much enjoyed this session, especially the use of the animated slides which showed how Kanban cards moved across the Board. This really helped to drive home the approach, and how (based on your needs) the Kanban board can be altered to include different columns and buffers, which can help increase the “flow” across the board. Would highly recommend this talk to anyone interested in getting started with Kanban.</p>

<p><strong>Session 2 – Computer, earl grey tea, hot</strong></p>

<p><strong>Presenter – </strong>John Price<strong> (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/johnnyjp">@johnnyjp</a>)</strong></p>

<p>Wow!</p>

<p>John Price has a very unique presentation style, that has to be seen to believed. I won’t spoil it in case people haven’t seen it, but let’s just say that the introduction included the opening credits to “Star Trek: The Next Generation” and a special visit from Captain Jean-Luc Picard.</p>

<p>This talk was based around the use of Home Automation technologies such as X10, and how these devices can be interacted with using software, including to my surprise, Windows Media Player. A very interesting example that was provided was the ability to dim the lights in a house when a video being watched through Windows Media Player was started, and brought back to full brightness when paused/stopped.</p>

<p>The only slight criticism of the talk would have to be that, initially, the demonstrations of the hardware involved didn’t work. Towards the end of the talk, John was able to reboot his machine and show each example working.</p>

<p><strong>Session 3 – Getting Started With ASP.NET MVC</strong></p>

<p><strong>Presenter – </strong>Steve Sanderson<strong> (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/stevensanderson">@stevensanderson</a>)</strong></p>

<p>I have really only “toyed” with MVC, you can see the fruits of my labour <a href="http://gep13.co.uk/">here</a>. Pretty isn’t it? The eagled-eyed amongst you will recognise it as the out-of-the-box MVC 3 application that ships with Visual Studio 2010 deployed to my web server <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/wlEmoticon-smile1.png" alt="Smile" />. As a result, I was very much looking forward to seeing how MVC could be used properly, from the person who quite literally wrote the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/ASP-NET-Framework-Experts-Voice-NET/dp/1430228865/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1307983241&amp;sr=8-1">book</a> on MVC (with the new release available <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pro-ASP-NET-MVC-Framework-3rd/dp/1430234040/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1307983241&amp;sr=8-2">here</a>).</p>

<p>The talk started off slowly, and quickly moved onto using the new MVC Scaffolding capabilities of Visual Studio. Of special interest was the separate installation of an additional scaffolding project (via nuget) which allowed the creation of a repository pattern for data access. This is definitely going on the list of things to check out.</p>

<p>Overall, a very good talk!</p>

<p><strong>Micro Presentations</strong></p>

<p>At lunch time there were a set of Micro Presentations. The format of which was 20 slides, each one lasting 20 seconds. To ensure that this was adhered to, each slide automatically transitioned to the next after 20 seconds! This made for some very interesting presentations, as each presenter tried to cram as much information as possible into 6 minutes and 40 seconds!</p>

<p>The presenters were <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/benjaminarroyo">@benjaminarroyo</a> (an introduction to NCrunch), <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Costall">@Costall</a> (a talk on Silverlight functionality), <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/FatherFil">@FatherFil</a> (Continuous Integration Build Monitors), <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/garyshort">@garyshort</a> (Asymptotics and Algorithms), <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/markrendle">@markrendle</a> (what you as a developer should be doing, i.e. reading books, blogs etc), and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/RossDScott">@RossDScott</a> (the making of the PocketDDD.com web site).</p>

<p>What was great about the Micro Presentations was the variety in which they were delivered. Everyone had a different take on how to best use the 20 seconds for each slide.</p>

<p>I particularly liked the idea of the “20 Sliders in 20 seconds” by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Costall">@Costall</a>, a very unique way to showcase the different capabilities of Silverlight, as well as the making of the PocketDDD.com using jQuery Mobile Framework and HTML 5. I am definitely going to be taking at look at NCrunch having seen it in action, and I am waiting on a copy of Mark’s slides to see what books and blogs were recommended reading as I didn’t have time to write them all down.</p>

<p>And special note has to go to Gary’s presentation. Having only had 45 minutes to prepare (he was travelling from NDC to DDDSW) his presentation went off very well, and gave lots of food for thought!</p>

<p><strong>Session 4 – Minimalist Software Development</strong></p>

<p><strong>Presenter – </strong>Mark Rendle<strong> (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/markrendle">@markrendle</a>)</strong></p>

<p>I was particularly intrigued by this talk. At work, we don’t often have the option to switch frameworks, and pretty much stick with what comes from the core Microsoft Stack. To see WebMatrix and NancyFX being used in action to create the same fully functioning site was very interesting.</p>

<p>In addition, to see <a href="http://blog.markrendle.net/2011/02/03/simple-data-is-out-there/">Simple.Data</a> in action was very useful. I have heard <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/stack72">@stack72</a> say a lot of good things about it, but I had never seen it used before. It is definitely going on the list of things that I have to check out.</p>

<p>Also, harking back to Mark’s earlier Micro Presentation with regard to good developers learning other languages and frameworks, the point was very much driven home in this presentation.</p>

<p><strong>Session 5 – Steps to reduce the friction in ASP.NET MVC</strong></p>

<p><strong>Presenter – </strong>Rob Ashton<strong> (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/RobAshton">@RobAshton</a>)</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately, for reasons that are best left to be discussed elsewhere, this session was cancelled. Which is a great shame as I was really looking forward to this talk having seen Steve Sanderson’s earlier talk on getting started with ASP.Net MVC.</p>

<p>Instead, I went down to the Sponsors room and had a very interesting chat with <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/stack72">@stack72</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/chriscanal">@chriscanal</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/richardadalton">@richardadalton</a></p>

<p><strong>Geek Dinner - Water Sky (Chinese restaurant)</strong></p>

<p>After a quick stop at the hotel to drop off bags and get changed, it was onto the Geek Dinner. Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/welshboy2008">@welshboy2008</a> for the lift to the restaurant, even though we did at one point end up going the wrong way round a roundabout <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/wlEmoticon-smile1.png" alt="Smile" />.</p>

<p>The food at the Geek Dinner was really good. There was a strange request from the staff that drinks were ordered/paid for separately, which caused an initial bit of confusion, but after the first couple of rounds, I don’t think anyone cared. After the food and drink it was back to the hotel for a quick drink and some more banter, and then an early night ready for the long trip back to Scotland.</p>

<p><strong>Overall thoughts of DDD South West</strong></p>

<p>Simply put, it was very good, and I would recommend anyone to attend it next year. Guy and his team did an amazing job putting it altogether, congratulations!</p>

<p><strong>Looking ahead…</strong></p>

<p>It was announced during the opening session of DDD South West that there is a brand new DDD event happening on the 8th October, in Sunderland. For more information on this event make sure that you follow <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/dddnorth">@DDDNorth</a> on Twitter.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Just tried to open MetroTwit this morning and I was greeted with what can only be described as one of the nicest looking, and most polite error messages that I have seen in a while. Here it is:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/image.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/image_thumb.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>The more detailed error message shows:</p>

<p>Just tried opening and closing the application but I get the same thing. Looks like I will have to revert to using the Twitter web site for now, but I will try MetroTwit again later.</p>

<p>Could this be a sign that the eagerly awaited Nest is making some changes, or is it more likely that new IT changes that came in over the weekend now prevent me from using Twitter at work <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/wlEmoticon-sadsmile.png" alt="Sad smile" /></p>

		<p>There are now only 5 sleeps until I start my travel down to <a href="http://www.dddsouthwest.com/">DDD South West</a>!!</p>

<p><strong><em>Looking forward to the day</em></strong></p>

<p>I debated for a long time as to whether I was actually going to attend this event, but in the end I decided that there were just too many good <a href="http://www.dddsouthwest.com/Agenda/tabid/55/Default.aspx">sessions</a> to pass up on. As is always the case though, there are just too many to pick from, and a number of the ones that I was hoping to see are on at the same time, so I might try to catch them in the Repeat Track. The Repeat Track is not something that I have seen at the other DDD events, and I am very curious to see how it works out.</p>

<p><strong><em>Getting there</em></strong></p>

<p>Rather naively, I thought that getting to Bristol was as easy as getting to London, and I left the organisation of the hotel and travel to the last minute (two weeks ago). When I came to try to book travel I was shocked by how much a flight was going to cost. It was going to cost something like £350-400 to get from Aberdeen to Bristol, and Train’s were not much better. As good as the sessions were, travel costs of that much was a bit steep and I started to wonder whether I was going to be able to make it at all.</p>

<p>Then I spoke to Craig (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/camurphy">@camurphy</a>) and Colin (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/colinmackay">@ColinMackay</a>) and found out that they were planning on driving down, so I asked if I could grab a lift, and luckily for me, they said that I could. As the driver, Craig did mention that he would have to:</p>

<blockquote>  
> 
>    
> 
> adopt a RyanAir baggage policy
> 
>    
> 
> </blockquote>


<p>Sorted! So, now all I have to do is travel down to meet Craig for the first leg of the journey to DDD South West.</p>

<p><strong><em>Windows Phone 7 Application</em></strong></p>

<p>In case you haven’t seen it, there is a Windows Phone 7 application for DDD South West (you can find it in the Marketplace by searching for “DDD SW 2011”.</p>

<p>The original version of this application simply listed any tweets on twitter that included the #dddsw hash tag, however, a recent update to the application now includes the agenda for the day. Screenshots below:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/DSCF5118.jpg"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/DSCF5118_thumb.jpg" alt="DSCF5118" /></a><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/DSCF5117.jpg"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/DSCF5117_thumb.jpg" alt="DSCF5117" /></a></p>

<p>I for one will be making extensive use of this application when I am trying to decide which sessions I want to go to.</p>

<p><strong><em>Helping out</em></strong></p>

<p>I have also volunteered to help out at this years DDD South West. I don’t know what exactly this will mean on the day, but I am sure that Guy Smith-Ferrier (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/GuySmithFerrier">@GuySmithFerrier</a>) will keep me right.</p>
