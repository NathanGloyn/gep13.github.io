	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>In case you hadn’t heard the DDD Conference, which this year has visited <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=28">Reading</a>, <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=210">Glasgow</a> and <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=278">Bristol</a>, is now coming to <a href="http://www.developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/north/Default.aspx">Sunderland</a>. This is going to take place on Saturday 8th October 2011, at the University of Sunderland.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I am not going to be able to make it to this event, I have already committed to going to <a href="http://www.givecamp.org.uk/">GiveCamp UK</a> later in October, and I can’t make both. However, if it is anything like the other DDD Conferences then I would highly recommend that you go along!!</p>

<p>Registration for the event is not open yet, however, they are accepting submissions for speakers on the day, so if you have a topic that you want to talk about, now is your chance to get a foot in the door.</p>

<p>To find out more information about the event check out the <a href="http://www.developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/north/Default.aspx">website</a> or you can follow <a href="http://twitter.com/dddnorth">@DDDNorth</a>, or you can use the #DDDNorth hash tag.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/all-in-one-code-framework/" itemprop="url">All-In-One Code Framework</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>This afternoon, while trying to find a sample that would help me create a Shell Extension for Windows Explorer, I stumbled across the All-In-One Code Framework on CodePlex:</p>

<p><a href="http://1code.codeplex.com/">http://1code.codeplex.com/</a></p>

<p>This is not something that I had heard of before, and the initial description of the project warranted some more investigation:</p>

<blockquote>  
> 
>    
> 
>     
>   * Are you frustrated by the lack of code samples for a certain programming task? 
>      
>   * Have you ever struggled to quickly get started with a technique? 
>      
>   * Have you expected someone to write code samples for you based on your requests for free? 
>      
>   * Is a one-stop code sample library for all Microsoft development technologies attractive to you?
>       
> 
> If your answer is YES to any of these questions, the Microsoft All-In-One Code Framework is for you!
> 
>    
> 
> </blockquote>


<p>After watching the introduction video <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Visual-Studio-Toolbox/Visual-Studio-Toolbox-All-In-One-Code-Framework">here</a>, I decided to get it installed.</p>

<p>There are two ways that you can use it, either as a <a href="http://1code.codeplex.com/releases/view/64539">standalone application</a> or as a <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/4934b087-e6cc-44dd-b992-a71f00a2a6df">Visual Studio 2010 Extension</a>. Due to the fact that the sample application is intended for use with the Express Editions of Visual Studio and because I am a hoarder of <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=3">Visual Studio Extensions</a>, I opted to install the Extension.</p>

<p>With this installed, you have two ways to access the available sample applications. The first is from the Tools Menu:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/All-In-Code-Framework_12560/All-In-One-Code-1.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/All-In-Code-Framework_12560/All-In-One-Code-1_thumb.png" alt="All In One Code 1" /></a></p>

<p>Clicking on this brings up this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/All-In-Code-Framework_12560/All-In-One-Code-3.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/All-In-Code-Framework_12560/All-In-One-Code-3_thumb.png" alt="All In One Code 3" /></a></p>

<p>Where you have the option to filter on keyword, language and technology.</p>

<p>The second method is to highlight a keyword within your code file and filter on that:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/All-In-Code-Framework_12560/All-In-One-Code-2.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/All-In-Code-Framework_12560/All-In-One-Code-2_thumb.png" alt="All In One Code 2" /></a></p>

<p>There are currently 678 sample applications that span a very wide area. The people behind this strive to create each sample using C#, VB.Net and C++, as well as for Visual Studio 2008 and Visual Studio 2010, so you should always be able to find sample in the language that you require. If you can’t, there is also the option to request a particular <a href="http://1code.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Request%20Code%20Sample%20from%20Microsoft%20All-In-One%20Code%20Framework&amp;referringTitle=Documentation">code sample</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have specified the location that you want to store the downloaded sample applications:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/All-In-Code-Framework_12560/image.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/All-In-Code-Framework_12560/image_thumb.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>You have the option to either download the sample applications as and when you require them, or you can download them all at once. Also, if an update to an application is published to the CodePlex site, the application notifies you of this, and gives you the option to upgrade.</p>

<p>All in all, I think that this is going to be a useful resource, and I would encourage you to take a look. Part of becoming a better programmer involves reading other peoples code, and this application gives you access to lots of it.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/a-modification-to-my-use-of-extensionsync/" itemprop="url">A Modification to My Use of #ExtensionSync</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>In an earlier <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=189">blog post</a> I mentioned how I am now using a very clever Visual Studio 2010 extension called <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/dbaf0ac9-fb7b-4fb3-b34d-ea2269276d3c">ExtensionSync</a> (a complete list of all the Visual Studio 2010 extensions that I am currently using can be found <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=3">here</a>).</p>

<p>In that blog post I explained that I am using a mapped drive in order in “share” the ExtensionSync settings file between different developers in the team. Initially, this worked well, but there were a few problems with this, and this was actually noted by the author of the tool in a Twitter conversation.</p>

<p>Basically, when you make a change, i.e. you add another extension, it saves the changes to the shared settings file it will work great until another developer who perhaps already had Visual Studio 2010 open, closes his Visual Studio. When this happens, his current extensions will be persisted to the shared ExtensionSync settings file, removing the extension that you just added. Not good!</p>

<p>After giving it some thought, it occurred to me that this file was actually living in the wrong place. This file should really be treated as an <em>artefact</em> of the project, and as such, should live in our source control repository.</p>

<p>The way our source control is configured, we have a folder called SharedSource. In here we keep things like, code analysis dictionaries, shared strong key files, shared code snippets, etc, so this seemed like a perfect place to put the ExtensionSync settings file.</p>

<p>With that checked in, it was a quick change to the ExtensionSync settings to point it at the new settings file location and everything was set up.</p>

<p>The benefit of using this approach is that unless “checked out” the settings file is read only, so that even if it wanted to, ExtensionSync can’t make changes to the file (I was worried that this would cause ExtensionSync to complain, but so far I haven’t seen this).</p>

<p>It also has the benefit of applying some process to making changes to the extensions that are used. A developer now have to go through the process of checking out the settings file, installing the extension, and then checking back in. This formality means that a little more thought is given to the addition of an extension, and should prevent ad-hoc extensions appearing that are of little or no use.</p>

<p>It strikes me as well that there is a logical extension (no pun intended) to this approach. For instance, depending on the project that you are working on, you may want/need different extensions installed. If you are working on a SharePoint development project then you would want all the SharePoint helper extensions installed. However, there is absolutely no need have these installed if you are working on an ASP.Net MVC project. As a result, you might have an ExtensionSync settings file per project, which you could switch to as and when required. If this could be made to do this automatically based on the currently loaded project this would be great, but I don’t know what sort of overhead this would involve in terms of installing/uninstalling extensions. Perhaps a feature request though…</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>The following is a list of the applications that I currently have installed on my HTC HD7 running Windows Phone 7. This is not intended to be a comprehensive list of “essential” Windows Phone 7 Applications, but rather a list that I will use for my own purposes (as a gentle reminder of what I have installed in case something ever goes wrong) and which will likely change over time as more applications are found.</p>

<p>Feel free to let me know about any apps that you have that you think that I would benefit from, I always like to hear about new things!</p>

<p><em>NOTE: If you are interested in how I got the URL’s for the applications listed here, take a look at this blog post </em><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/mobile/find-id-of-windows-phone-7-app-and-create-direct-zune-marketplace-link/"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p><strong><strong>MarketPlace Applications</strong></strong></p>

<p><a href="http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&amp;id=48195fb4-ee0e-e011-9264-00237de2db9e">Amazon Kindle</a> – Thanks to Amazon’s WhisperSync technology picking up your book from where you left off is just a joy</p>

<p><a href="http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&amp;id=28822e51-cf15-440c-b97a-2c1671986fa4">Another Level</a> – A very nicely put together app, that is VERY useful!</p>

<p><a href="http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&amp;id=744d9d43-ee65-e011-81d2-78e7d1fa76f8">Bing Get Me There</a> – I used this on my last trip to London, and it is an absolute must!</p>

<p><a href="http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&amp;id=2f9d08aa-b17b-e011-986b-78e7d1fa76f8">British Airways</a> – This is an application that I use a lot, mainly because I don’t fly BA all the time, but it is a very nice sample application of what can be achieved.</p>

<p><a href="http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&amp;id=ddd1ad08-d9d5-df11-a844-00237de2db9e">Cocktail Flow</a> – Like the <a href="http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&amp;id=2f9d08aa-b17b-e011-986b-78e7d1fa76f8">British Airways</a> application, this is one I use as a reference application more than anything else</p>

<p><a href="http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&amp;id=dc5f12fa-b49d-e011-986b-78e7d1fa76f8">Currency</a> – Just one of those apps that you should have installed.</p>

<p><a href="http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&amp;id=2e49fb07-592b-e011-854c-00237de2db9e">Flickr</a> – When nice application for looking at your photostream and your friends.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>On Thursday 7th July, the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group was lucky enough to welcome <a href="http://www.kodefuguru.com/">Chris Eargle</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/kodefuguru">@KodefuGuru</a>), a Telerik Developer Evangelist from Columbia, South Carolina, to do a talk entitled “<a href="http://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Meetings/Secrets-of-a--Net-Ninja.aspx">Secrets of a .Net Ninja</a>”.</p>

<p>Due to the format of this presentation, primarily focused around code demonstrations, there was only an introductory set of slides, so I have not posted them here.</p>

<p>However, all of the code (and much, much more) that Chris talked through on the night is available at his CodePlex Project which you can find <a href="http://kodefu.codeplex.com/">here</a>. I am in the process of downloading the latest version as I type <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" />.</p>

<p>There was no messing around in this talk, we jumped straight into talking about:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Private Member Inheritance</p></li>
<li><p>Removing the use of Out Parameters</p></li>
<li><p>Extension Method Refactoring</p></li>
<li><p>Advanced use of LINQ, Lambdas and Anonymous Methods
There was a lot of content in this presentation, and there was certainly a lot of food for thought. The sample code helps in cementing how these techniques can be used in your day-to-day programming activities.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Unfortunately I wasn’t able to go, but some of the guys took Chris to the <a href="http://www.brewdog.com/">BrewDog</a> bar for a round of <a href="http://www.brewdog.com/sink_the_bismark">Sink The Bismarck</a> after the meeting, I hope he doesn’t miss his flight back home to the states today!</p>

<p>Big thanks to Chris for taking time to visit the <a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Home.aspx">Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group</a>.</p>

<p>Don’t forget about our next event which is happening on the Thursday 21st July 2011. <a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/">Paul Stack</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/stack72">@stack72</a>), a Continuous Integration enthusiast, is travelling up to present his talk entitled “<a href="http://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Meetings/Beginners-Guide-to-CI.aspx">Beginners Guide to CI</a>”. I have seen this talk once before (although I know he has added some parts to it since I last saw it so interested to see what he has lined up) and I would encourage anyone who is interested in getting started with CI, or even if you are already using it, to come along.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>As some of you may have noticed, I have switched from using the #ADNUG hash tag to using #ADNUGUK on Twitter. This is due to the fact that there was a clash with the <a href="http://www.adnug.org/">Austin Dot Net User Group</a>, as well as the <a href="http://www.adnug.com/">Adelaide Dot Net User Group</a>, so if you are ever mentioning the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group can I ask you to use #ADNUGUK.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/i-did-not-know-that-fiddler-could-do-this/" itemprop="url">I Did Not Know That #Fiddler Could Do This…</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>One of the most essential tools for working on web development is Fiddler:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/">http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/</a></p>

<p>For those who don’t know:</p>

<blockquote>  
> 
>    
> 
> Fiddler is a Web Debugging Proxy which logs all HTTP(S) traffic between your computer and the Internet. Fiddler allows you to inspect all HTTP(S) traffic, set breakpoints, and &#8220;fiddle&#8221; with incoming or outgoing data. Fiddler includes a powerful event-based scripting subsystem, and can be extended using any .NET language.
> 
>    
> 
> </blockquote>


<p>This tool has helped me out in a number of situations, and it is actually one of the first things that I <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=198">install on my machine</a> if I ever need to rebuild it.</p>

<p>The other day when using Fiddler I was blown away by a feature that I had not seen before. Namely, the ability to filter HTTP traffic coming from a single process. The concept is by no means a new one, but it is the way in which Fiddler does it that I thought was very clever.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Steps</em></strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Open your web browser ready for inspecting traffic</p></li>
<li><p>Open Fiddler</p></li>
<li><p>Find the “Process Filter” toolbar item in the main toolbar</p></li>
</ol>


<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/image.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/image_thumb.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<ol>
<li>Hover your mouse hover this and you will see the following tooltip which pretty much explains it all. Click your mouse on the “Process Filter” button and the text will change to say “pick target…” and the icon will change to be a cross hair.</li>
</ol>


<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/image1.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/image_thumb1.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<ol>
<li><p>With the left mouse button still held down, move the mouse to the window (process) that you want to filter the HTTP target from. In this case, it is the web browser that you opened in step 1, but it could equally be any other application that is communicating over HTTP.</p></li>
<li><p>The “Process Filter” button will change again to show the process id that it is filtering HTTP traffic from</p></li>
</ol>


<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/image2.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/image_thumb2.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<ol>
<li>Once you are finished, simply left click the “Process Filter” toolbar item again and the filter will be removed.</li>
</ol>


<p>In my case, if I open Fiddler on my non development machine I have HTTP traffic coming from Windows Live Mesh, Outlook, OneNote, BookMark synchronisation, etc. Trying to figure out what is going on with one “thing” can be difficult, this filtering ability makes it very easy, and as I mentioned I think the way in which you select the process to filter on is VERY clever.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/very-much-looking-forward-to-givecampuk/" itemprop="url">Very Much Looking Forward to @GiveCampUK…</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>In case you haven’t heard about it, there is a very exciting event coming up on the weekend of the 21st October 2011. It’s called GiveCampUK:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.givecamp.org.uk/">http://www.givecamp.org.uk/</a></p>

<p>The idea behind this event, which was first started in Dallas, Texas, is that a bunch of like minded developers get together and help out a group of charities and non-profit organisations with their technology requirements. My understanding is that this could range from creating a website from scratch to deploying a WordPress Blog that they require for their site.</p>

<p>At present, the event has fulfilled it’s quota for required volunteers (developers, designers and database administrators), but if you are interested, you can still <a href="http://www.givecamp.org.uk/volunteer">sign up</a> to be on a shortlist in case some people have to drop out.</p>

<p>I am delighted to say that I have made it onto the list and I am very much looking forward to taking part in the event, although, having never done anything like this before, I have to admit that I am a little bit nervous. What makes it worse is that I know that there are a lot of VERY talented developers taking part in the event. This is great for the charities, as they will get the benefit of the wealth of their combined experience, but from a personal stand point, it does make it a little intimidating <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Looking-forward-to_1194B/wlEmoticon-sadsmile.png" alt="Sad smile" />.</p>

<p>However, I am determined to make this most of this experience, as I firmly believe that I will get as much out of this, as hopefully the charities will get from me. It is a great chance to socialise with and learn from other developers, and be exposed to technologies and processes that I might otherwise not have seen.</p>

<p>For more information on the event, you can find the organisers on Twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/givecampuk">@GiveCampUK</a>) and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/GiveCampUK">FaceBook</a>.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/can-net-user-groups-get-office365-for-free/" itemprop="url">Can .Net User Groups Get @Office365 for Free?</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>For a few months now I have been using the Office365 Beta to run the email accounts for the <a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/">Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group</a> and I am happy to say that it has been working really well, and in all honesty, it “just” works.</p>

<p>I have it hooked up through Outlook on my desktop as an Exchange Account, and also through my Windows Phone 7. Initially, there were a couple teething problems to get the <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=260">required DNS entries sorted out</a>, but that was more of a problem with my hosting provider than anything else.</p>

<p>As a User Group we are “toying” with the idea of perhaps using the supplied SharePoint Team Site to host the actual .Net User Group Website and fully utilise the built in Document Library functionality of SharePoint to share documents/slide decks with our users, as well as collaborate on User Group documents.</p>

<p>Now comes the problem though…</p>

<p>Since the Office365 program is now out of Beta, you now have to pay for the service. <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/wlEmoticon-sadsmile2.png" alt="Sad smile" /></p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, this is not a huge amount of money, it starts at £4 per user, per month (full details can be found <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/office365/online-software.aspx">here</a>), but given that we are a User Group who runs free events for the community, there simply isn’t any budget allocated for this type of service.</p>

<p>So, as an open question to Microsoft (are you there?) I would like to request that this service be provided free of charge to .Net User Groups across the country.</p>

<p>We (.Net User Groups) are investing a lot of time in energy in bringing events to our members and informing them about your technology stack so I think it would be a great idea if this service could be provided to help us continue to do this.</p>

<p>So…</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

		<p>Last year I was struggling to think what I could get my dad for his Christmas. Every year it is the same problem, and normally the same sort of present gets bought, namely something to do with Golf. Don’t get me wrong, he loves his Golf, and he plays just about every weekend, so I don’t think he minds getting Golf related presents, but I always try to get him something different. In the past, this has ranged from “geek” related presents like a Bluetooth hands free kit for his car to Billy Connolly DVDs. However, this time I wanted to do something different, and after trawling the internet, I stumbled across this website:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.giftexperiencescotland.com/">http://www.giftexperiencescotland.com/</a></p>

<p>Which led me to <a href="http://www.giftexperiencescotland.com/driving-vouchers/offroad-driving-gift-voucher/extended-4x4-offroad-driving-experience-near-aberfeldy./product-detail-EXP139/">here</a>, which is provided by a company called <a href="http://www.highlandsafaris.net/leisure/">Highland Safaris</a>.</p>

<p>So I ended up buying him this on the understanding that I would be the “other” person that he would be taking along with him (I made sure that this was understood very early in the process <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/wlEmoticon-smile2.png" alt="Smile" />)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Photo_65094934-7CE5-2FDF-0208-CB9AB0984248.jpg"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Photo_65094934-7CE5-2FDF-0208-CB9AB0984248_thumb.jpg" alt="Photo_65094934-7CE5-2FDF-0208-CB9AB0984248" /></a>This last weekend (25th June), we travelled down to Dull, just west of Aberfeldy to the Highland Safaris Centre. For those of you who are interested, this is the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Highland+Safaris,+Aberfeldy,+United+Kingdom&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=56.618324,-3.934908&amp;spn=0.037213,0.077162&amp;sll=56.61719,-3.93744&amp;sspn=0.009304,0.01929&amp;geocode=CeGWL-mfSgx7FRLwXwMdV83D_ynxI6kX6aSISDE7st8IwrS1uw&amp;z=14">location</a>.</p>

<p>The Centre itself is very easy to find, and it has a small shop and Cafe. After checking in at reception we were told that our Instructor, Bob, would be ready in about 20 minutes, so we decided to grab some food at the Cafe and wait.</p>

<p>As promised, after 20 minutes or so we were ready to go. We were asked to stand in front of a map and told about the route that we were going to be taking, and what we were getting to do. However, there was no mention of us actually driving the land rover, and there also seemed to be more people coming along than I expected. I thought it was just my father and I. A quick word with the Instructor sorted everything out. Turns out there were two sets of “Park” checked in. One for a family highland safari (which had just been explained to us) and one for a 4x4 Driving Experience.<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Photo_BF421791-BEE1-66D7-6DAC-1CB53C39D1E9.jpg"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Photo_BF421791-BEE1-66D7-6DAC-1CB53C39D1E9_thumb.jpg" alt="Photo_BF421791-BEE1-66D7-6DAC-1CB53C39D1E9" /></a></p>

<p>With all that sorted out, we were introduced to the machine that we would be getting to drive. <em>Ain’t she a beaut?</em></p>

<p>After our Instructor drove us to the starting point we then each took turns in driving over various sections of terrain including muddy sections of road, through water, and some very steep down hill sections. In total, between the two of us, we had 2 and a half hours of driving, which I felt was very good value for money.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Photo_887318B5-1AD6-1509-14EC-9287D5B30A3E.jpg"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Photo_887318B5-1AD6-1509-14EC-9287D5B30A3E_thumb.jpg" alt="Photo_887318B5-1AD6-1509-14EC-9287D5B30A3E" /></a></p>

<p>Here is a photo of my dad driving through one of the sections of water. It wasn’t particularly deep, but still not something that you get to do in normal day to day driving.</p>

<p>Along the way we got to see some stunning views (see below), the countryside and wildlife around Aberfeldy is stunning, and I would recommend that anyone go there for a visit. At one of the highest points on the drive, called the “View Point” we stopped to have a quick dram of a local Whisky (Dewar’s White Label) and as we were standing having a chat we saw two buzzards flying around overhead, it really was quite impressive.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Photo_67E19F6B-E072-4BB1-9AB1-260F6FF1AD0F.jpg"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Photo_67E19F6B-E072-4BB1-9AB1-260F6FF1AD0F_thumb.jpg" alt="Photo_67E19F6B-E072-4BB1-9AB1-260F6FF1AD0F" /></a></p>

<p>For me, one of the most amazing parts of the day was the land rover itself. At one point while I was driving, I came up to a particularly steep section of track. The instructor then told me to put it into first gear, let it start to pull away, and then take both my feet off all the pedals, and just concentrate on steering. At first, I thought he was joking, but he was quite serious. In doing this, you then essentially let the engine take over, and it will control everything for you, allowing you to safely descend. This meant that it would maintain a constant speed and rate of descent by controlling the braking and acceleration. Now, you could argue that this takes some of the “fun” out of it, but if you had seen the steepness of the hill, I think you would have happily let the land rover take over as well!! It truly is an amazing piece of engineering.</p>

<p>All in all, it was a great day out, and I can wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone. Now the only problem it what to get Dad for Christmas this year!!</p>

All going well, I am planning on attending this event, but the way work has been going, I might have to give it a miss <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/wlEmoticon-sadsmile1.png" alt="Sad smile" /></p>

<p>TypeMock Isloator is one of the licenses that we are able to give away at the <a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/">Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group</a>, so if you have already been lucky enough to win one of these licenses, this Webinar will be a great way to get started using it.</p>

<p>The agenda for the meeting is as follows:</p>

<p>• Common problems with unit testing, and how to solve them    <br/>
• Applying unit testing patterns to legacy code     <br/>
• How to test the untestable     <br/>
• Cutting fluff with Typemock Isolator’s powerful mocking capabilities     <br/>
