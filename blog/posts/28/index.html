		<p>Ok, let me just state that I have been a great man of the X Files, ever since it came out, and I have watched every episode, watched the film, and read the books, so needless to say, I was really looking forward to this new <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443701/">film</a>.</p>

<p>Having watched the trailer for the movie, and seen Billy Connolly on his knees with what looks like the “Black Oil” coming out his eyes, I thought the long running story line of alien gunk was going to be continued in this movie&hellip;.</p>

<p>&hellip;how wrong could I be. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, the movie was good, but it wasn&rsquo;t like the X Files of old, and if anything, it was like an extended episode, not a film.</p>

<p>Also, it just wasn’t right to see Mulder and Scully getting it on <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/wlEmoticon-smile2.png" alt="Smile" /></p>

		<p>Today me and Lynn headed up to Edmonton to check out the West Edmonton Mall. The mall itself was absolutely massive!! I haven&rsquo;t been to anything like it in the UK, it quite simply has everything!! Shops (probably 2-3 of each kind), Ice Skating, Swimming Pool, Roller-Coasters, Food Stalls, Sea Lion shows, everything. You can check out some pictures of the trip below:</p>

<p>[nggallery id=23]</p>

<p>However, what was the best thing about the trip?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s right, the hire car!!! No idea how or why, but the second hire car that we got was a Mustang!! It was an absolutely amazing car!! You can see some pictures of it below:</p>

		<p>If I had to sum up this film in one word, what would it be?</p>

<p>HILARIOUS!!!!</p>

<p>Me and Lynn went to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0838283/">Step Brothers</a> today, and I think I can say that we both really enjoyed it!! It was really funny, Will Ferrell and John Reilly did a great job of playing the characters. The beating up of the school yard bullies at the end of the film was maybe a little over the top, but all in all, a great film!!!</p>

		<p>After meeting up with the people from my work at Atlas for lunch, me and Lynn headed to the Calgary Tower. I had wanted to take Lynn for a meal at the top in the revolving restaurant, however, it was going through some renovation while she was here. You can check out the pictures from the top of the tower below:</p>

<p>[nggallery id=21]</p>

<p>Please don&rsquo;t ask about the picture of and the beaver, I honestly have got no idea what I was thinking!!</p>

<p>After the Calgary Tower we headed to the Stampede Casino. Had a really good time playing on the Black Jack table and the slot machines. The cocktails in there are really good!! Didn&rsquo;t have quite as much luck as I did the last time I was there, but still had a good time!!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Me and Lynn took a few days to travel up to Banff to do some of the touristy things.</p>

<p>With the car hired, we travelled up to Banff, but we stopped on the way to visit Canmore and have some lunch. You can see some photos of that below:</p>

<p>[nggallery id=15]</p>

<p>Then it was back on the road to our final destination the Rimrock Hotel (took a slight detour with the GPS, but got there). The hotel was amazing, felt a fit underdressed with my shorts and t-shirts, but what the eh!! Had to get our room changed, since I had paid for an unobstructed view, and there was a tree right in front of our window. You can see some of the photos of the hotel below:</p>

<p>[nggallery id=20]</p>

<p>While we were waiting for our room to get sorted out, we went up on the Gondola ride to the top of Sulphur Mountain. The views from the top were amazing!!!  See for yourself:</p>

<p>[nggallery id=19]</p>

<p>The next day, we got back in the car and went in past Lake Louise:</p>

<p>[nggallery id=17]</p>

<p>on the way to our final destination which was a helicopter ride over the Rockie Mountains:</p>

<p>[nggallery id=18]</p>

<p>Lake Louise was really nice, the colour of the water was just magnificent, has to be seen to be believed. We didn&rsquo;t really have a lot of time at Lake Louise, since we had to get up the road for the chopper ride, you could have easily spent the whole day at Lake Louise. So it was back in the car, and onto the chopper!! We decided that we wanted to do the Nature Hike as well as the chopper ride, so after 20 minutes in the chopper (I got the front seat) the pilot landed, and we took a quick walk to a nearby waterfall. Lynn didn&rsquo;t really want to investigate, but I couldn&rsquo;t stop myself walking up to the edge and peering over.</p>

<p>The next day, we wandered round the shops in Banff and bought some presents for everyone:</p>

<p>We had a great time, and you can see the photos from here:</p>

<p>[nggallery id=14]</p>

<p>It is a long story, but there is also a 20 minute video of me being dressed up as a tiger, and basically being humiliated, still haven&rsquo;t found a way of showing this on my site, but I think it will be making its way onto Lynn&rsquo;s Bebo page at some point, so keep your eyes open for it, it is quite funny!</p>

<p>We also got stuck in a hail storm while on our way back from the zoo, but not to worry, we bought some very sexy white ponchos to protect us!! <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/wlEmoticon-smile1.png" alt="Smile" /></p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Today, me and Lynn went to see the new Will Smith film, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0448157/">Hancock</a>. For a while, it was difficult to see where this film was going, on one hand you had a reluctant hero in the form of Will Smith, and a seemingly normal family who takes pity on him. However, there is more to the normal family than meets the eye.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t say too much more, in case anyone hasn&rsquo;t seen it, but I get the impression that the writers were trying a bit to hard to fit the whole story into the time allotted though! It was worth a watch, but don&rsquo;t think I will be buying it on DVD.</p>

		<p>Had a little bit of a movie marathon today, went to see both:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0411477/">Hell Boy II: The Golden Army</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/">The Dark Knight</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>Let me first say that I really enjoyed the first Hell Boy movie, but I was a little bit let down by this film!! I really can&rsquo;t put my finger on why I didn&rsquo;t like it, but I just didn&rsquo;t like it. I have spoken to a few people since who have said that they really enjoyed it, so maybe I missed something, but&hellip;..</p>

<p>Following Hell Boy, I was on a bit of a downer, but then I watched The Dark Knight, and that feeling quickly went away, it was GREAT!!! At one point during the film, I thought that maybe it was going to stop, because I thought that the whole Harvey Dent alter ego would be the making of the next film, but they wrapped it all up in this one. All in all though, it was great!!!</p>

		<p>Yesterday I got a very strange parcel delivered to me at work. I had no idea what it was, as I wasn&rsquo;t expecting any parcels, but on opening, I discovered that it was my friend, Gary the Coconut. He had decided that he wanted to join me on my adventure in Calgary, so he posted himself all the way from Aberdeen!! (This is true, he was helped on his way by Wes and Nicole, who posted him from Edmonton, but it was still a long trip!!) I am sure he will have a great time here in Calgary, and I will keep you posted on his antics.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Due to the fact that our business Headquarters are in Canada, there are a fair number of Canadians in our Scottish Office. One Friday evening, the Canadians decided that they were going to have a night of Nintendo Wii fun round at the company flat, and I was invited to come along. Initially, I thought that this would be a great idea, so I said that I would come along. However, later that night, my plans changed, and I wasn&rsquo;t able to come along, so I text them to let them know that I wouldn&rsquo;t be attending.</p>

<p>The following Monday, I was told that I had missed a really good night, and as the stories of the evening were recited, I realised that I probably should have attended. Days passed, and I thought that was the end of it, however, I was wrong&hellip;..</p>

<p>[singlepic id=1204 w=320 h=240 float=]</p>

<p>Turns out, that rather than be without a Gary at the party, the Canadians thought it would be a good idea to replace a Scottish Gary with someone else, and so <strong>Gary The Coconut</strong> was born.</p>

<p>Since that night, Gary The Coconut has ventured out into the world, in lots of different ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>He has got his own <a href="http://www.facebook.com/people/Gary_Park/1155266863">Facebook account</a></p></li>
<li><p>He has been Skiing</p></li>
<li><p>He has been White Water Rafting</p></li>
<li><p>He has been to a BBQ</p></li>
<li><p>He has been to lots of parties</p></li>
</ul>


<p>He has made lots of friends along the way, however, his best friend in the whole wide world has to be Wes:</p>

<p>[singlepic id=1211 w=320 h=240 float=]</p>

<p>Where will Gary The Coconut go next? No one knows&hellip;.</p>
