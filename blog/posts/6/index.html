	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/does-your-development-rig-support-slat/" itemprop="url">Does Your Development Rig Support SLAT?</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Have you checked to make sure that your development rig supports SLAT?  Do you even know what SLAT is?  I didn’t until today, and it looks like I am going to have to upgrade at least one of my machines.</p>

<h1>What is SLAT?</h1>

<p>SLAT is referring to Second Level Address Translation, and it is a:</p>

<blockquote>…form of hardware virtualization that is included in newer version of Intel and AMD Processors, such as Intel’s Core i3, i5 and i7 processors and AMD;s Barcelona processors.</blockquote>


<p>For more information on exactly what this means, take a look at this <a href="http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/talsa/archive/2012/03/15/windows-8-server-hyper-v-will-require-slat-second-level-address-translation.aspx">blog post</a> from Tal Sarid.</p>

<h1>Why do I care?</h1>

<p>The reason that this is going to be a big deal for me, and why I am going to have to buy some new hardware is that the Windows Phone 8 emulator uses Hyper-V, and as a result, I am going to need hardware that supports SLAT if I want to run that emulator.  For more information on this, take a look at this <a href="http://www.wpcentral.com/windows-phone-8-emulator%E2%80%99s-hardware-requirements">wpcentral blog post</a>.</p>

<h1>How can I check whether my hardware supports SLAT?</h1>

<p>Thanks for Mark Russinovich, there is a Sysinternals tool called Coreinfo, which will tell you whether your current hardware can support SLAT.  See Ryan Lowdermilk’s <a href="http://www.ryanlowdermilk.com/2012/09/does-my-computer-support-slat/">blog post here</a> for the exact steps that you need to follow.</p>

<h1>My results</h1>

<p>For my desktop machine, which in fairness is VERY old, SLAT is not supported:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/does-your-development-rig-support-slat/desktop_output/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Desktop_Output.png" alt="SLAT not support on Desktop" /></a></p>

<p>The good news however is that SLAT is supported on my laptop:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/does-your-development-rig-support-slat/laptop_output/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Laptop_Output.png" alt="SLAT is support on Laptop" /></a></p>

<p>NOTE: The important thing that you need to look for (for Intel chips) is the asterisk next to EPT.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Based on the comment from Andy Westgarth below, if you are running coreinfo.exe on a machine that already has Hyper-V installed, you will get a different message returned.  Be careful to read all the output from this command.  When Hyper-V was installed on my new machine, this is the output that I got:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/does-your-development-rig-support-slat/2012-09-27_2033/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/2012-09-27_2033.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Note the important text:</p>

<p><em><strong>&ldquo;Coreinfo must be executed on a system without a hypervisor running for accurate results.&rdquo;</strong></em></p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<h1>session submission has been accepted for DDD North</h1>

<p>I am very happy to announce that the <a href="http://caliburnmicro.codeplex.com/">Caliburn.Micro</a> session that I submitted for <a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/north2">DDD North</a> has been accepted!  The abstract for this session was:</p>

<h1>Getting Started with Caliburn.Micro and Windows Phone 7</h1>

<blockquote>Getting started with the Windows Phone 7 Development Platform is relatively simple, however, using a Framework like Caliburn.Micro takes away some of the more mundane tasks, and allows you to focus on what you are trying to achieve.  In this session we will start with a blank Windows Phone 7 project, and start to create our first Windows Phone 7 application using features such as:

> 
> 
    
>   * ActionMessages
> 
    
>   * Action Conventions
> 
    
>   * Binding Conventions
> 
    
>   * Navigation Service
> 
    
>   * The Bootstrapper
> 
    
>   * The IPhoneService
> 
    
>   * Tombstoning
> 
    
>   * Lauchers and Choosers
> 
    
>   * The IWindowManager
> 

</blockquote>


<p>This is a new talk for me, and I am very much looking forward to doing it.  I am currently using Caliburn.Micro in the two Windows Phone 7 applications that I am involved with, and I really think that it is a great framework to build on.</p>

<p>Registration for <a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/north2">DDD North</a> opens tomorrow, 28th August, at 1pm, so in order to avoid disappointment, make sure that you are signed into the website, ready to click on the registration button.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I have been meaning to post this for a while, but with one thing and another, I just haven’t had time.  However, as some of you will know, I have been banging on about this update for a LONG time!  What feels like ages ago now, Nokia finally announced that they were going to bring internet tethering to the Nokia Lumia 800 (a feature that I have been sorely missing since I moved from my beloved HTC HD7 to the Nokia Lumia 800), however, it took over a month to get the update onto my phone.</p>

<p>Anyway, the day finally arrived, and the installation, as always, went very smoothly:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/2012-08-07_0729.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/2012-08-07_0729_thumb.png" alt="2012-08-07_0729" /></a></p>

<p>You may or may not see the following screen.  As soon as I got the notification that the update was ready I went ahead and installed it, which meant using the work computer, which I haven’t set up my phone on.  It’s good to know that it can be done in this way though.</p>

<p>With the update completed, I immediately checked the Settings page, and I am very happy to report that the “Internet Sharing” function is now available on my Nokia Lumia 800.  In fact, I am actually away to publish this blog post from my laptop, which is currently tethered to the phone <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" />.</p>

<p>Other features that came along with this update includes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Flip to silence — Silence incoming calls by turning your phone face down.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix to prevent the volume of the ringtone from temporarily increasing</p></li>
<li><p>Download new apps from Marketplace, such as camera extras, including smart group shot and self-timer, Contacts share, and Play To, a DLNA app for showing your content wirelessly.</p></li>
<li><p>Usability and performance improvements</p></li>
</ul>


<p>This update took the Nokia Lumia 800 handset to the following state:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>OS Version: 7.10.8773.98</p></li>
<li><p>Firmware revision number: 1750.0805.8773.12220</p></li>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Now that the dust has settled with the latest round of updates for my Nokia Lumia 800, I thought that it was time to blog about the update experience.  This is in line with my previous posts on the subject, and it is more a record for myself, than for anything else.</p>

<p>There was a lot of discussion about this set of updates, especially following the announcements regarding Windows Phone 8, and the fact that there was no upgrade path from a Windows Phone 7 device, and what if anything, we were going to be getting from this update.  A lot of people thought that this update would include the new Windows Phone “Start Screen”, but this isn’t the case.</p>

<p>This update is the so-called “Tango” update.  There wasn’t a lot to shout about within this update, but it does have a couple of interesting new additions.  In order to complete the update, there were actually two back to back updates applied to the Windows Phone.</p>

<p>In the same way as all of my Windows Phone updates to date, the installation/backup procedure worked perfectly, and the screenshots from the experience can be seen below.<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/2012-07-23_2129.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/2012-07-23_2129_thumb.png" alt="2012-07-23_2129" /></a></p>

<p>On completing this update, I straight away went to the Settings screen to see if the Internet Sharing function was available, however, it still wasn’t!  I immediately started googling, and talking to people on Twitter, only to find out that there was actually another update (on top of the two that I had just applied).  This final update was a vendor specific update (in my case Nokia), that would enable this feature.  At this point, this update wasn’t available, so I still had to wait patiently.</p>

<p>For more information about what was included in this update, you can take a look at the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/howto/wp7/basics/update-history.aspx">Windows Phone update history</a> page.</p>

<p>This update took the Nokia Lumia 800 handset to the following state:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>OS Version: 7.10.8773.98</p></li>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Last Christmas, I got an amazing present from my family…</p>

<p>A round of golf on Donald Trump’s new Golf Course, “Trump International Scotland”.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/my-round-of-golf-on-trump-international-scotland/wp_000300.jpg/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/WP_000300-300x225.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> Below you will see a gallery of some of the photos that I took on the day.</p>

<p>Well, the 27th July 2012 finally came round, and my dad, my sisters boyfriend, his dad and myself, headed for Trump International.</p>

<p>You have to give Donald Trump credit, he certainly knows what he is doing.  The drive up to the Golf Course is spectacular!  Once we were all signed in, we took advantage of the driving range, and pitching/putting area, which not to put to fine a point on it, are in better condition than some actual Golf Courses that I have played!</p>

<p>It was then time to head out on the course.  We were greeted at the first tee by the starter, who pointed us in the right direction, and explained which tee we should be playing off.  For us, it was the Green tees, since the white tees were closed, and the Blue tees were only recommended for single handicappers, which we aren’t, not by a long shot.  He did recommend that we take a look at the views from some of the Black tees, which we did, and all I can say is, they are amazing!  You can see some of these below.</p>

<p>Granted, we did get an amazing day for playing the course.  The sun was out, and there was very little wind.  This definitely helped the scores, and the number of lost balls count.  On any other day, the narrow fairways, elevated tees, sandy fairways, deep bunkers, and fast greens, would not have been so forgiving!</p>

<p>All in all, we had a fantastic time, and I would highly recommend playing this course.  There are still some areas where the course needs work, and time to bed in, but that will come with time.  Congratulations to Donald Trump for bringing a great Golf Course to the North East!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Hot on the heels of <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/my-impressions-of-dddsw-4/">DDD South West</a>, it is now almost time for <a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/north2/Default.aspx">DDD North</a>.  All of the proposed sessions have been submitted, and it is now time for the community to vote for which sessions they would like to see.</p>

<p>This year I committed myself to start speaking at community events, and this started with my <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/dddsw-4-stylecop-breaking-down-the-barriers-to-entry/">StyleCop presentation</a> at DDD South West, and this will hopefully continue at DDD North.  I have submitted 3 sessions, the details of which can be seen below, and I am hoping that one of them will be selected.</p>

<p>Of course, if this doesn’t happen, I am still planning on attending DDD North as it looks like there is an awesome line up of speakers and everything that I heard about the inaugural event last year is that this isn’t to be missed!</p>

<p><em><strong>NOTE:</strong> There is of course still </em><a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/ddd10/"><em>DDD10</em></a><em> in September, but, unfortunately, I am not able to attend this year, gutted!  From what I understand, the tickets for this event are now all booked up, but if you are still looking to attend, make sure that you get yourself onto the waiting list.</em></p>

<p>If you are interested in attending DDD North, you can find out all the information about it <a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/north2/Default.aspx">here</a>, and you can vote for the sessions that you would like to see <a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/north2/Users/VoteForSessions.aspx">here</a>.  Voting for the proposed sessions for DDD North closes on the 24th August, so if you are looking to attend, be sure to vote for the sessions that you would like to see (hopefully one of mine).  Registration for the event opens on the 28th August 2012.  In order to avoid disappointment, make sure that you are logged into the site on the morning that the registration opens so that you can get your ticket.</p>

<p>Here are my session submissions….</p>

<h1>Getting started with Caliburn.Micro and Windows Phone 7</h1>

<blockquote>Getting started with the Windows Phone 7 Development Platform is relatively simple, however, using a Framework like Caliburn.Micro takes away some of the more mundane tasks, and allows you to focus on what you are trying to achieve.  In this session we will start with a blank Windows Phone 7 project, and start to create our first Windows Phone 7 application using features such as:

> 
> 
    
>   * ActionMessages
> 
    
>   * Action Conventions
> 
    
>   * Binding Conventions
> 
    
>   * Navigation Service
> 
    
>   * The Bootstrapper
> 
    
>   * The IPhoneService
> 
    
>   * Tombstoning
> 
    
>   * Lauchers and Choosers
> 
    
>   * The IWindowManager
> 

</blockquote>


<h1>StyleCop – Breaking down the barriers to entry</h1>

<blockquote>Starting with a brief introduction to what StyleCop is, and what it can be used for, we will then apply StyleCop directly to a real world application.  Then we will investigate:

> 
> 
    
>   * What breaks?
> 
    
>   * What doesn’t work?
> 
    
>   * What techniques we can use to correct StyleCop warnings/errors, and ignore them completely?
> 
    
>   * What tools can be used to speed up refactoring for StyleCop warnings/errors?
> 

</blockquote>


<h1>Nuget – What on earth is it?</h1>

<blockquote>You have probably heard in passing about this mystical thing call Nuget, but what actually is it?  In this talk we will breakdown exactly what Nuget is, and who you can integrate it into your Source Control, as well as how to create and consume your own Nuget packages.</blockquote>


<p>If you are interested in attending DDD North, you can find out all the information about it <a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/north2/Default.aspx">here</a>, and you can vote for the sessions that you would like to see <a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/north2/Users/VoteForSessions.aspx">here</a>.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/scottish-developers-have-a-new-committee-member-me/" itemprop="url">Scottish Developers Have a New Committee Member… Me!</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I am happy to announce that I am now a fully signed up member of the <a href="http://scottishdevelopers.com/">Scottish Developers User Group</a>.  Over the last year, I have been working more and more with the guys at Scottish Developers (Andy Gibson – <a href="http://twitter.com/argibson">@ARGibson</a>, Craig Murphy – <a href="http://twitter.com/camurphy">@CAMURPHY</a>, and Colin Mackay – <a href="http://twitter.com/camurphy">@ColinMackay</a>) in order to bring speakers to Scottish User Groups, and I was thrilled when I was invited to become a committee member!</p>

<p>Working directly with Scottish Developers has meant that we have been able to bring people like Scott Hanselman – <a href="http://twitter.com/shanselman">@shanselman</a>, Matt Lacey – <a href="http://twitter.com/mrlacey">@mrlacey</a>, Sebastien Lambla – <a href="http://twitter.com/serialseb">@serialseb</a>, Gill Cleeren – <a href="http://twitter.com/gillcleeren">@gillcleeren</a>, and Mark Rendle – <a href="http://twitter.com/markrendle">@markrendle</a> to Scotland, to do User Group presentations.  This typically means doing a tour of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.  These events seem to have gone down really well, and this is definitely something that we are looking to continue.  It is much easier to get speakers to commit to a series of events in Scotland, rather than a single event, as it makes the trip more worthwhile.  If there is anyone in particular that you are interested in seeing in Scotland, feel free to get in touch, and we will see what we can do.</p>

<p>In addition to the regular monthly events, I will also be getting involved in helping with the setup and running of the Annual Events, such as DDD Scotland, and DunDDD, as well as the general day-to-day running of the User Group.  This doesn’t mean that I will be neglecting the <a href="http://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/">Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group</a>.  This will continue to exist in it’s own right, and host regular monthly events.</p>

<p>I attended my first Scottish Developers Annual General Meeting on the 7th July 2012, where I was formally introduced as a committee members.  You can see photos from the day below.</p>

<h1>DDDSW Speaker Feedback Results are in</h1>

<p>Last week the speakers at DDDSW received their feedback evaluations forms, myself included.</p>

<p>Now, I have to say that I was a bit nervous about getting these feedback forms as this was my first time doing a session at a conference the size DDDSW, However, I am happy to report that I am VERY happy with the results. Thank you to everyone who attended my session, and who provided the valuable feedback on my session. I will take all of your comments away, and try to improve this session going forward. It is clear from the feedback that the session was rushed towards the end, and this was due to the fact that I was over-running slightly. I will have to look at the content and move some things around in order to make the timings better.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>While preparing for my <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/dddsw-4-stylecop-breaking-down-the-barriers-to-entry/">StyleCop presentation at DDDSW</a> I created a number of scripts for the demos that I wanted to show during the presentation.  For the first demo, which was a simple introduction to what StyleCop is and how it can be used, the script went like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Create new Windows Forms Application using C#</p></li>
<li><p>Show that the Project Builds successfully</p></li>
<li><p>Run StyleCop at the solution level and show that there are <strong>30 Warnings</strong> out of the box (yes, this may seem like a lot of warnings for a brand new project, with no custom code, but this was covered in later demos.  If you want more information about how this can be corrected easily, feel free to give me a shout).</p></li>
<li><p>Run StyleCop on Form1.cs and show that there are <strong>12 Warnings</strong> out of the box</p></li>
<li><p>Open StyleCop Settings and enter Copyright Information, as well as disable analysis of designer files</p></li>
<li><p>SA1633: Insert a copyright header to the top of Form1.cs using code snippet</p></li>
<li><p>Run StyleCop on Form1.cs and show that there are <strong>11 Warnings</strong> left</p></li>
<li><p>SA1600: Insert a Summary Tag (with correct text) for the Form1 constructor</p></li>
<li><p>Run StyleCop on Form1.cs and show that there are <strong>10 Warnings</strong> left</p></li>
<li><p>SA1200: Move all using statements within namespace</p></li>
<li><p>Run StyleCop on Form1.cs and show that there are <strong>2 Warnings</strong> left</p></li>
<li><p>SA1601: To show the use of a SuppressMessage, suppress this warning</p></li>
<li><p>Run StyleCop on Form1.cs and show that there are <strong>1 Warnings</strong> left</p></li>
<li><p>SA1101: Put a this. in front of the call to InitializeComponent</p></li>
<li><p>Run StyleCop on Form1.cs and show that there are <strong>0 Warnings</strong> left</p></li>
<li><p>Rejoice in the fact that StyleCop now runs with no warnings</p></li>
</ul>


<p>This was the plan, however, it turns out that this wasn’t going to be as easy as I thought!</p>

<p>When I first started creating my StyleCop Demos, and the scripts to go with it, I was using StyleCop 4.7.23 which at the time was the latest version, but unfortunately there was a bug in StyleCop surrounding SA1101.  Information on this can be found <a href="http://stylecop.codeplex.com/workitem/7266">here</a>.  What made things a little more interesting is that even though StyleCop wasn’t picking up the violation, the StyleCop for ReSharper plugin that I use was picking it up:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Problem_with_this._and_resharper.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Problem_with_this._and_resharper_thumb.png" alt="Problem_with_this._and_resharper" /></a></p>

<p>This didn’t make for a good demo, so I set about changing the script for the demo such that this bug wouldn’t be mentioned.  The morning of Saturday 26th May 2012 comes around and I am sitting in the speaker room adding the finishing touches to my slides and demos, only to find out that there is a new version of StyleCop been released, version 4.7.26.  Doing a little bit of digging, it appeared that this release fixed the issue that I was seeing, so with 1 hour before my presentation was due to start, I decided to install the latest version of StyleCop.</p>

<p>Now, I know that there are probably a lot of seasoned presenters out there that are shouting:</p>

<blockquote>WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU THINKING!!</blockquote>


<p>But, I am happy to say that the uninstall and reinstall of StyleCop went off without any problems, and on running through the script that I mentioned above, both StyleCop and StyleCop for ReSharper, correctly identify the violation:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/corrected_problem_with_this._and_resharper.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/corrected_problem_with_this._and_resharper_thumb.png" alt="corrected_problem_with_this._and_resharper" /></a></p>

<p><em>NOTE: The above screenshot is actually taken using StyleCop 4.7.27 (which was released on Tuesday 29th May 2012) and actually includes a new rule SA1126.  This appears to supersede the original violation which was SA1101.</em></p>

<p>So, long story short, if you are seeing oddities when running StyleCop, and StyleCop for ReSharper plugin, make sure that you have the most recent version of StyleCop installed.  In order to find out about new releases you can subscribe to the Release Notifications email on the CodePlex site <a href="http://stylecop.codeplex.com/releases/view/79972">here</a>.  You will need to log into CodePlex before you can enable this.</p>

		<h1>dddsw was fantastic!</h1>

<p>There is very little else to say.  The speakers were great, the venue was perfect, the food was amazing, and the geek chat wasn’t to be missed.  If you have never attended DDDSW, or for that matter one of the other DDD events around the country then you really need to think about going.  They are incredible events, and best of all, they are completely free!</p>

<p>In a slight change to the previous DDD events that I have attended, I was presenting a session this time around which meant that the stress levels were on high alert, but overall, this additional pressure didn’t detract from the day, and I had a great time!</p>

<h1>first session at dddsw</h1>

<p>Although there were a number of talks that I would have liked to have seen in this first session, I decided that I should finalize my demos and slides ahead of the second session where I would be presenting.</p>

<h1>second session at dddsw</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Gary Ewan Park (yes, me, it’s still bizarre to say this)</p>

<p><strong>Topic:</strong> StyleCop – Breaking down the barriers to entry</p>

<blockquote>Starting with a brief introduction to what StyleCop is, and what it can be used for, we will then apply StyleCop directly to a real world application.  Then we will investigate:

What breaks?
What doesn’t work?
What techniques we can use to correct StyleCop warnings/errors, and ignore them completely?
What tools can be used to speed up refactoring for StyleCop warnings/errors?</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> I leave that up to the people who attended my session, but overall, I was happy with how it all went.  There are certainly a couple of things that I would do differently if I were to do the session again (for instance, actually have my slide notes in front of me), but for a first attempt, I was very happy with it.</p>

<p>I did see one tweet that I was particularly happy with, especially since on at least a couple of occasions the demos didn’t work the way I wanted them to:</p>

<blockquote>In @[gep13](https://twitter.com/gep13) &#8216;s StyleCop session. Very fluid and polished demos and session :) [#dddsw](https://twitter.com/search/%2523dddsw)

<h1>third session at dddsw</h1>

<p><strong>Presenters:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/garyshort">Gary Short</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/plip">Phil Winstanley</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/serialseb">Seb Lambla</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/fatherfil">Phil Collins</a> and running the show <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/robertbracken">Rob Bracken</a></p>

<p><strong>Topic:</strong> Smartphone Wars (Balloon Debate)</p>

<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>This was a really entertaining debate, which saw Blackberry, iOS, Windows Phone and Android being pitted against each other.  The first casualty (being represented by Phil Collins) we Blackberry.  Closely followed by iOS which was being defended by Seb Lambla.  This left Windows Phone (supported by Phil Winstanley) and Android (with Gary Short) left.</p>

<p>As expected (given the number of .Net Developers and Windows Phone owners in the room) Windows Phone came out on top.  All joking aside though, the debate through up lots of interesting arguments about one phone OS over the other, and it left a lot of food for thought!</p>

<h1>grok talks and 20/20 sessions</h1>

<p>As now seems to be the tradition, there were Grok Talks and 20/20 presentations over lunch.  I was able to catch the last three of these, on <a href="https://github.com/slodge/MvvmCrossConference">MVVMCross</a>, <a href="http://offonourown.com/OffOnOurOwn/Welcome.html">WiFi Access Points around the world</a>, and <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/twickers/archive/2012/05/27/dddsouthwest-4.0-26th-may-2012---async-2020-presentation.aspx">async</a>.  These were all very entertaining, and my credit goes out to everyone who presented, especially the 20/20&rsquo;s, as although short, this type of talk is particularly difficult to execute!!</p>

<h1>fourth session at dddsw</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Jimmy Skowronski</p>

<p><strong>Topic: </strong>No More Passwords!</p>

<blockquote>Passwords are surrounding us, thousands of websites are asking us to register every day. At some point we tend to loose control over them and start either using the same password everywhere or escape to a password vault solutions. Many of you are building new websites almost every day and you often you need users to log in. Don&#8217;t create your own password storage in that case. Save your users from the need to create and remember yet another login and password, and use one of the existing identity providers. It can be Live ID, Facebook, Google, Twitter, Yahoo or many other and you can choose one of them or all together.

This session will show you how to get rid of your individual password storage and authenticate your user using OAuth with Live ID, Google and Facebook. You will be amazed how simple it is and your users will be amazed how cool you are.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>This was a very interesting talk!  Making use of a DLL which ships with WebMatrix, Jimmy was able to show how you can quickly enable OAuth authentication for your sites, which allows users to register using Google, Windows Live, Facebook, Twitter, etc.  Although the source code wasn’t quite ready for sharing on the day, Jimmy did mention that he will be blogging about it going forward, and if you are interested you can find the info <a href="http://jimmylarkin.net/post/2012/05/27/DDD-South-West-OAuth-Session.aspx">here</a>.</p>

<p>For his session, Jimmy tried out a new idea where he used the website that he was constructing as a replacement for a set of presentation slides.  This is a great idea, in theory, unfortunately, it didn’t really work in practice.  The choice of font, style and layout meant that unless sitting on the very first row, it was difficult to read and follow.  With a little bit of work, I could see this technique being really useful, and it certainly given a new meaning to the term dog-fooding.</p>

<h1>fifth session at dddsw</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter:</strong> Nathan Gloyn</p>

<p><strong>Topic:</strong> Is your code S.O.L.I.D?</p>

<blockquote>Everybody keeps on about SOLID principles but what are they? and why should you care?

In this session I&#8217;ll aim to walk through each principle telling you about that principle and examining why you should use it.

Once we&#8217;ve talked about the principle in theory we&#8217;ll look to how we can put it into practice refactoring an existing application.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> What can I say about this session…. Quite simply, it was the best session that I attended all day.  Nathan is a great speaker, and the demos that he provided clearly spell out each of the different principles.  With the source code downloaded, you can literally do a kDiff between the two projects to see what refactoring were put in place to implement each principle.  Huge congratulations to Nathan for a great session!!  The only thing that I would request, and this is purely selfish on my part, but I would love to see another project added which shows how you can start to include Unit Tests.  I really think that this would go a long way to closing the loop on how “best” to construct your code.</p>

<h1>missing friends</h1>

<p>Unfortunately, Craig Murphy (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/camurphy">@CAMURPHY</a>) wasn’t able to attend DDDSW.  There was speculation whether this was the first ever DDD that he has missed!!  He was there in spirit though…</p>

<p><img src="https://public.sn2.livefilestore.com/y1pKZ9x9DqjZI5nRCcTesMhloER1N3Jdty2o3cDqA32YiDq2WHKEJtkqJ64DzGPkaL0FZReSgwOAwbqvwjB-EbZzA/fa.jpg?psid=1" alt="" /></p>

<h1>sponsors and organisers</h1>

<p>A huge thank you has to go out to all the <a href="http://dddsouthwest.com/Sponsors/tabid/63/Default.aspx">sponsors</a> of DDDSW, as well as the <a href="http://dddsouthwest.com/TheTeam/tabid/68/Default.aspx">organisers</a>!  Without them this excellent event would not have happened.  Thanks!</p>

<h1>dddsw 5 in 2013</h1>

<p>The day after the event, I jokingly asked Guy Smith-Ferrier if he had already set a date for the next DDDSW, and as expected he said no.  Him and the rest of the organisers are going to take a well deserved break, however, I would definitely recommend that you keep an eye out for the next event, and if you can make it along, you won’t regret it.  I will certainly be in attendance if nothing else gets in the way!  One of the best ways to here about the event would be to follow <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/dddsouthwest">@dddsouthwest</a> on twitter.</p>
