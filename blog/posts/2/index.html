	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<h1>Get your tickets now!</h1>

<p>I wanted to let you know about an upcoming event in Aberdeen that I have been helping to arrange. It is taking place on Friday 18th October 2013.  The event in question is the Northern Lights 2013 Conference.  The website for the conference can be found here:</p>

<p><a href="http://northernlightsconf.co.uk/">http://northernlightsconf.co.uk/</a></p>

<p>The event is in its third year, and this year the theme is tools.  Both the tools that we use, and the tools we build.  There is a wide range of speakers available, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://northernlightsconf.co.uk/speakers/2013/09/23/hadi-hariri.html">Hadi Hariri</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://northernlightsconf.co.uk/speakers/2013/09/23/kendall-miller.html">Kendall Miller</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://northernlightsconf.co.uk/speakers/2013/09/23/kate-stone.html">Kate Stone</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://northernlightsconf.co.uk/speakers/2013/09/23/glenn-henriksen.html">Glenn Hendrickson</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>Who are offering up an exciting line up of talks.</p>

<p>In addition, there will be two open spaces at the conference, where attendees will have an opportunity to suggest a topic for an interactive conversation with other attendees and speakers.  If you haven’t been to an open space before, they are fantastic.  It is a perfect opportunity to interact with other like mind people about a topic that you are interested in.  The best way to get something out of this is to suggest a topic that you are especially interested in, and hopefully other people will get involved as well.</p>

<p>Tickets are £15 for the day, which includes coffee and lunch for regular attendees, and Students tickets to the talks are free, plus you can buy a lunch ticket for £5.</p>

<p>We hope to see you there.  If you have any questions about the event, then please don’t hesitate to get in touch with me.</p>

<p>If you know anyone else who would be interested in attending this event, I would really appreciate it if you could forward on this email.</p>

<p>This event is lovingly sponsored by:</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/windows-phone-8-gdr2-update-finally-arrives-nokia-lumia-925-3-network/" itemprop="url">Windows Phone 8 GDR2 Update Finally Arrives for My Nokia Lumia 925 on the 3 Network</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I am happy to report that the GDR2 update for my Nokia Lumia 925 has finally arrived.  I say finally because it is almost 1 month after it arrived for my wife&rsquo;s phone!  We are not on the same operator, so this is obviously showing the difference in turning around the updates for the Windows Phone eco-system, and it has to be said that this really is a sad state of affairs!  I really hope that this turn around time for pushing out the updates improves, as getting the latest features for my handset is very important to me.  Almost important enough to consider switching mobile phone providers.</p>

<p>Almost 1 month ago, I convinced my wife that she should upgrade her mobile phone to the Nokia Lumia 925.  To my annoyance, one day after receiving the handset, she was prompted that there was an update available for the phone.  I started the update process, which actually consisted of two back to back updates, and after checking, this update was the much rumored <a href="http://winsupersite.com/windows-phone/complete-guide-windows-phone-8-gdr2">GDR2 update</a>.</p>

<p>Following the update, the various version numbers changed as follows:</p>

<table >
<tbody >
<tr >

<td >
</td>

<td >**Original**
</td>

<td >**First Update**
</td>

<td >**Second Update**
</td>
</tr>
<tr >

<td >**OS Version:**
</td>

<td >8.0.10327.0
</td>

<td >8.0.10327.0
</td>

<td >8.0.10328.0
</td>
</tr>
<tr >

<td >**Firmware revision number:**
</td>

<td >3040.0000.1322.2004
</td>

<td >3040.0005.1323.3004
</td>

<td >3047.0000.1326.2006
</td>
</tr>
<tr >

<td >**Hardware revision number:**
</td>

<td >1.0.0.0
</td>

<td >1.0.0.0
</td>

<td >1.0.0.0
</td>
</tr>
<tr >

<td >**Radio software version:**
</td>

<td >3.2.04018.1
</td>

<td >3.2.04018.1
</td>

<td >3.2.04028.1
</td>
</tr>
<tr >

<td >**Chip SOC version:**
</td>

<td >8960
</td>

<td >8960
</td>

<td >8960
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>Fast forward 1 month, and after a twitter conversation with the support team at 3, which was a little coincidental (by the way, I am not claiming responsibility for getting the update released :-)), the GDR2 update arrived for my phone:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/gep13/status/384990097176657922">https://twitter.com/gep13/status/384990097176657922</a></p>

<p>One interesting thing is that although the OS version between the two phones is the same, the firmware version numbers are different.  You can see the comparison table between the original and update on my phone below.  Both the firmware revision number, and the radio software version numbers on my phone are higher than on my wife&rsquo;s phone.</p>

<table >
<tbody >
<tr >

<td >
</td>

<td >**Original**
</td>

<td >**Update**

<tr >

<tr >

<td >3040.0000.1322.2003
</td>

<td >3049.0000.1330.0004
</td>
</tr>
<tr >

<td >**Hardware revision number:**
</td>

<td >1.0.0.0
</td>

<td >1.0.0.0
</td>
</tr>
<tr >

<td >**Radio software version:**

<td >3.2.04018.1

<td >3.2.04033.1
</td>

<tr >

<td >**Chip SOC version:**
</td>

<td >8960
</td>

<td >8960
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>To summarize, in addition to the huge difference in time between pushing out the updates between the mobile phone providers, it also looks like they are choosing to release different updates.  It would be really interesting to find out why they are doing this.  To me, this seem a little bit troubling.  I know the carriers have a right to decide which updates are released to the handsets that they are in charge of, but to go an entire month after one of your competitors releases the update seems very excessive to me.  Let&rsquo;s hope the release process improves with the forthcoming GDR3 update.</p>

<p>You can see a gallery of the screenshots that I took during the update process below.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<h1>Open and edit a .ai file using Expression Design</h1>

<p>The other week, I needed to edit the original source files for the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group in order to change the size of the png&rsquo;s that I use for various things (like avatar&rsquo;s, etc).  Unfortunately, these were created using Adobe Illustrator, which I don&rsquo;t have access to.  I had a hunt around, but I couldn&rsquo;t find a way to do it.  Enter Twitter&hellip;</p>

<p>The ever knowledgeable Scott Lovegrove (<a href="https://twitter.com/scottisafool">@scottisafool</a>), made a great suggestion of using Expression Design to open and edit the files.  I had thought that Expression Design was only part of the Expression Studio, which I also don&rsquo;t have, but&hellip;</p>

<h1>Expression Design is free!</h1>

<p>Although it used to only be part of the Expression Studio, Express Design is now actually free!  You can download it from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36180">here</a>.</p>

<h1>Opening and Editing the file</h1>

<p>This couldn&rsquo;t be simpler!  Open up Expression Design, and open the file.  Once open, you will have the option to Export the image:</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_2076&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;1171&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Expression-Design-Export-Menu.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Expression-Design-Export-Menu.png" alt="Expression Design Export Menu" /></a> Expression Design Export Menu[/caption]</p>

<p>On the next window, you will then be able to choose the output format, and also the size of the resulting image:</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_2077&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;1206&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Expression-Design-Export-Options.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Expression-Design-Export-Options.png" alt="Expression Design Export Options" /></a> Expression Design Export Options[/caption]</p>

<p>Simples!  Thanks again Scott!</p>

		<h1>My adventures in updating my Chocolatey Pull Request</h1>

<p>About 3 months ago, I submitted a <a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/238">pull request</a> to the <a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey">Chocolatey Project</a>.  This was a reasonably simple addition, which added a helper method within Chocolatey which allowed the creation of a generic shortcut anywhere that the user required.  As time passed, other commits were made into the Chocolatey Master branch, and my pull-request had become &ldquo;dated&rdquo;.  In addition, in hindsight, I had created 6 commits, for something that could have really been done as a single commit.</p>

<p>Last week, Chocolatey contributor Rich Siegel (<a href="https://twitter.com/rismoney">@rismoney</a>), suggested that I should rebase my pull-request against the latest in the master branch, and also to &ldquo;tidy&rdquo; up the multiple commits into a single commit.  The reason to do this was really two-fold:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>rebasing against the master branch would mean that merging would be simpler</p></li>
<li><p>making it one commit would mean that the commit history would be cleaner, and if any bugs were introduced as a result of the pull-request(s) it would be easier to find this in the history</p></li>
</ul>


<p>My immediate response was, &ldquo;I would love to do this, but how the hell do I do that?!?&rdquo;.  Thankfully, Rich was able to spell it out in terms that even I was able to understand!  So that I can refer back to this in the future, I decided to capture the details in this blog post.</p>

<h1>Where we were&hellip;</h1>

<p>This was the situation that I was in:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I had taken a fork of the Chocolatey code into a new repo</p></li>
<li><p>I had created a branch called Issue-235 which is where my commits had been added</p></li>
<li><p>By branch was behind chocolatey/master by a few commits</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>Where we wanted to get to&hellip;</h1>

<p>Where we were trying to get to was:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>My branch brought up to the latest code that was in master</p></li>
<li><p>Rewrite commit history by reducing all commits (I had 6) into just one</p></li>
<li><p>Update single commit comment to include all details</p></li>
<li><p>Update pull request</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>What was required</h1>

<p>The following gist contains all the commands that were executed:</p>

<p>The final part of what was desired, i.e. updating the pull-request with the changes, haven&rsquo;t <em>automagically</em>.  Thinking about it, this makes sense.  Your pull request is &ldquo;linked&rdquo; to the commits in your forked branch.  When this changes, the pull request is also updated.</p>

<p>I have to say a big thanks to Rich for all his help on this.  I learnt a lot by doing this!</p>

<h1>Should Contributors keep their pull requests up to date?</h1>

<p>Within the discussion of this pull-request, Chocolatey creator Rob Reynolds (<a href="https://twitter.com/ferventcoder">@ferventcoder</a>) suggested that it wasn&rsquo;t the responsibility of the creator of the pull request to keep it &ldquo;up-to-date&rdquo;, but rather for the project coordinators to either accept or reject the pull request quickly enough that keeping it up-to-date would not be required.  Personally, I think that this would be the &ldquo;ideal&rdquo;, but that we don&rsquo;t live in an ideal world.  Time constraints always mean that things don&rsquo;t happen as quickly as we would like, and as a result, we, as the community, should do what we can to help out.</p>

		<h1>Increasing my Synology DS1512+ RAM to 3GB</h1>

<p>I have to say, I love my <a href="http://www.synology.com/products/product.php?product_name=DS1512%2B">Synology DS1512+</a>!  Out of the box, it comes with 1GB of RAM, which, if you are solely doing file sharing, is more than enough.  However, over the last couple months, I have started doing more and more with my Synology Server:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Hosting Web Sites</p></li>
<li><p>Running a Plex Media Server</p></li>
<li><p>Backing up to the Cloud using CrashPlan</p></li>
</ul>


<p>As a result, I have noticed that certain things are taking longer than they &ldquo;should&rdquo;.  I decided that I wanted to increase the amount of RAM that is in the device.  Digging around the <a href="http://forum.synology.com/enu/">Synology Forums</a> it was clear that this is possible (with some people reporting that they were able to get 4GB to be recognised), it is just a case of deciding what RAM to go for.</p>

<p>I opted to go for <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0050X1OQ6/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">this from Amazon</a>, and I am happy to report that it all worked perfectly!  After installing, the RAM was immediately detected, and the Synology Server is running very smoothly.  Definitely recommend the upgrade to anyone who has not yet done it.  Very cheap to do, with a marked improvement in performance.</p>

		<h1>Full day developer session in Scotland</h1>

<p>It is with great pleasure that I am able to tell you that, with the help of Scottish Developers, Microsoft Evangelists <a href="http://mtaulty.com/communityserver/blogs/mike_taultys_blog/default.aspx">Mike Taulty</a> and <a href="http://andywigley.com/">Andy Wigley</a>, are going to be doing a full day of sessions in Edinburgh on Saturday 1st June 2013.  It is expected that the day will run from 10am - 4pm, consisting of four different topics:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Windows 8</strong> - The Developer Overview</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Windows Phone 8</strong> - The Developer Overview</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Azure Mobile Services</strong> - Quick, Easy, and Powerful Mobile Backends</p></li>
<li><p>Architecting &amp; Building Shared Code for Windows and Windows Phone</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Currently, full details of the sessions, and what is going to be contained within them, is still being prepared, but if the session names are anything to go by, this is going to be a great day!  Registration for the day is open, and spaces are limited, so I would encourage you all to get registered as soon as possible.  You can find the registration page <a href="http://mikeandandy2013-eorg.eventbrite.com/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I won&rsquo;t be able to make it as I will be moving into our new house the day before, but I look forward to hearing all about it!</p>

<h1>Sponsors</h1>

<p>If there are any companies out there who would like to help sponsor the event, in order to provide food and refreshments, then any help would be gratefully received.  Feel free to get in touch either through me, or by tweeting <a href="https://twitter.com/scottishdevs">@scottishdevs</a>, or emailing <a href="mailto://support@scottishdevelopers.com">support@scottishdevelopers.com</a></p>
