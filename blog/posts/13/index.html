	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Sadly, the Progressive .Net Tutorials 2011 have come to an end, but I am happy to report that I have had a great time. The quality and content of the sessions has been amazing, and the guys at Skills Matter do a great job in making sure that everything ticked over correctly.</p>

<p>A big congratulations has to go to everyone at Skills Matter! Thank you!</p>

<p>The thing that I really liked about the Progressive .Net Tutorials is the extended time of the sessions. Each session ran for almost 4 hours. This meant that you had plenty of time to digest the content of the presentation, and if required, to ask questions. In the case of the final session on the 3rd day, you were actually given time to try out the products that were being presented. This was great as it meant you got some time to “play” and if you had any questions, you could ask the experts in the room.</p>

<p>The other thing that I was amazed at was the speed at which Skills Matter were able to turn around the videos of the sessions. Before the end of the day, the video for the morning session was available to watch on their site. Truly amazing!! Now what I need to do is find some time to watch the videos for the sessions that I was not able to attend <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/35aceb50ed2b_AF56/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" />.</p>

<p>For a round up of each of the sessions that I attended you can take a look at the following links:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=361">Day 1 - Morning Session</a> - Ian Cooper and Sebastian Lambla.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=362">Day 1 - Afternoon Session</a> - Dylan Beattie.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=363">Day 2 - Morning Session</a> – Simon Brown</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=364">Day 2 - Afternoon Session</a> – Paul Stack</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=365">Day 3 - Morning Session</a> – Jon Skeet</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=372">Day 3 - Afternoon Session</a> – Mark Rendle and Steven Robbins</p>

<p>So, the real question, would I attend the Progressive .Net Tutorials in 2012?</p>

<p>The answer?</p>

<p>Quite simply…</p>

<p><strong><strong>YES! Highly recommended to everyone!</strong></strong></p>

<p>If you are interested in hearing about the next Progressive .Net Tutorials, as well as other sessions offered by Skills Matter, make sure you follow them on <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/skillsmatter">Twitter</a>, or check them out on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/company/53564?trk=tyah">Linkedin</a>.

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I had a lot of trouble deciding on the final session of the final day at the Progressive .Net Tutorials. The choice was between Nathan Gloyn (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/nathangloyn">@nathangloyn</a>) and his “<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/ajax-ria/you-think-you-know-agile">You think you know agile?</a>” and the “<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/ajax-ria/introduction-to-nancy-and-simple-data">Introduction to Nancy and Simple.Data</a>” talk featuring Mark Rendle (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/markrendle">@markrendle</a>) and Steven Robbins (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/grumpydev">@grumpydev</a>).</p>

<p>Why the debate? Well, let me tell you…</p>

<p>We have recently tried and failed to implement an Agile approach in a project, so I am fairly sure that we will not be using an Agile approach for the foreseeable future. Coupled with the fact that I have seen an earlier Kanban talk from Nathan, initially I was leaning towards Mark and Steven’s session. In addition, in a recent blog <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=313">post</a> I talked about how is was striving to becoming a better developer and in order to do this I feel I need to learn more languages and frameworks, and the Nancy and Simple.Data talk seemed to fit that bill perfectly.</p>

<p>In the end, I opted to attend the Nancy and Simple.Data talk (sorry Nathan <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/beed2e344009_119E0/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" />)</p>

<p>This session was split straight down the middle. The first half was devoted to an introduction to both Nancy and Simple.Data, and the second half was handed over to the delegates to create a sample “To Do” application. This format worked really well. It gave me the opportunity to directly apply what we had been told about, with the benefit of having Mark and Steven in the room, if there were any questions.</p>

<p>What struck me immediately about both packages is how quickly you can get up and running with both of them. There are NuGet packages available for both and each one are split into a number of smaller packages so that you can only take what you need.</p>

<p>For instance:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>install-package Nancy.Hosting.Self</p></li>
<li><p>install-package Nancy.Hosting.AspNet</p></li>
<li><p>install-package Nancy.Hosting.Wcf</p></li>
<li><p>install-package Nancy.Hosting.Owin</p></li>
<li><p>install-package Nancy.Viewengines.Razor</p></li>
<li><p>install-package Nancy.Authentication.Forms</p></li>
</ul>


<p>And:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>install-package Simple.Data.SqlServer</p></li>
<li><p>install-package Simple.Data.SqlCompact40</p></li>
<li><p>install-package Simple.Data.Core</p></li>
<li><p>install-package Simple.Data.Mysql</p></li>
</ul>


<p>This is a prime example of the packaging that was described in the <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=361">first session on Monday</a>.</p>

<p>Once the core packages were installed:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>install-package Nancy.Hosting.AspNet</p></li>
<li><p>install-package Simple.Data.SqlServer</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Getting a basic website up and running is as simple as:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; Hello : NancyModule
    {
        &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; Hello()
        {
            Get[&lt;span class="str"&gt;"/"&lt;/span&gt;] = _ =&gt; &lt;span class="str"&gt;"Hello World!"&lt;/span&gt;;
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>And:</p>

<pre><code>        &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; Main(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;[] args)
        {
            var db = Database.OpenNamedConnection(&lt;span class="str"&gt;"prognet”&lt;/span&gt;);
            var hello = db.Hello.FindById(1);
            Console.WriteLine(&lt;span class="str"&gt;"{0} {1}!"&lt;/span&gt;, hello.Greeting, hello.Subject);
        }
</code></pre>

<p>Simples!</p>

<p>With this fully discussed, Mark then showed a more fully functional sample in the form of his “Heckle” application which you can find linked below.</p>

<p>Speaking to Mark after the session the one problem that I had was, I couldn’t see past how you actually use Nancy and Simple.Data in a “proper” application. By that I mean an application that fully separates the layers/tiers, UI, BLL and DAL, etc. Mark pointed me at <a href="https://github.com/ToJans/NerdBeers">NerdBeers</a> which I am going to have to take a look at, as I think it will go along way to cement my understanding.</p>

<p>All in all, a great session that seemed to be enjoyed by all!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>First up on this last day of the Progressive .Net Tutorials was Jon Skeet (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jonskeet">@jonskeet</a>) and his “<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/ajax-ria/async-methods-in-c-sharp-5-2389">Async Methods in C# 5</a>” talk.</p>

<p>Like Paul Stacks talk yesterday, this was a very well attended talk, and rightly so.  I had never seen a Jon Skeet presentation before but I have heard him on various pod casts and videos, but he is a great presenter who has a natural talent at explaining complicated scenarios in a easy to understand way.</p>

<p>Jon started out with some very impressive slides (a example of which can be seen <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/archive/2011/05/08/eduasync-part-1-introduction.aspx">here</a>) and explained the “asynchronous” techniques that have been used to date in earlier versions of the framework:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>BeginFoo</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Callback</p>

<ul>
<li>EndFoo</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>OnSuccess</p></li>
<li><p>OnError</p>

<ul>
<li>Go!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>And then began explaining what awaits (do you like my pun? <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/184b90d28369_BB7D/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" />) us in C# 5.</p>

<p>I have to say that the usage of the async and await keywords is very appealing, and it is reasonably easy to see how it could be applied in a code base.</p>

<p>Following this, Jon then went onto discuss his Eduasync sample code which, rather than using the Microsoft Visual Studio Async CTP, re-writes the implementation.  Although it was interesting to see how all the pieces fit together, Jon did make clear that it is unlikely that you would ever need to write any code like this, but rather it was just “fun” to do.</p>

<p>At the end of the talk I can honestly say that my head hurts!  I went into this talk having never played with the Parallel Extension in .Net 4.0 and having read hardly anything C# 5 Async, and although I got “some” of the concepts, I would still have a lot to learn.  This is really something that I would need to place with in anger in order to concrete my understandings.  The first port of call will be to go back and read Jon’s series to blog posts <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/archive/tags/Eduasync/default.aspx">here</a>.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>In the afternoon it was the turn of Paul Stack (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/stack72">@stack72</a>) and his “<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/ci-to-cd">Continuous Integration to Continuous Delivery</a>”</p>

<p>I was expecting a lot from this session, and I am happy to say that I was not disappointed!</p>

<p>I have seen Paul’s Continuous Integration talk before, and I was very curious to see how you would transition from Continuous Integration to Continuous Delivery/Continuous Deployment.</p>

<p>Paul went on to explain that the core practices of Continuous Delivery break down as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Continuous Integration</p></li>
<li><p>Configuration Management</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Dependencies</p></li>
<li><p>Documentation</p></li>
<li><p>Environment</p></li>
<li><p>App Configurations</p></li>
<li><p>Data</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Tests</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Unit</p></li>
<li><p>Integration</p></li>
<li><p>Functional/Acceptance</p></li>
<li><p>Performance/Load</p></li>
<li><p>Penetration</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Now, getting all these things in place is no small task, and it is only something that can be achieved over a period of time, it is not going to happen over night. However, once you have it in place, you can build and deploy (as Paul showed) your web application to a web server in a matter of seconds. When you sit and think about this, this is actually very impressive!  When I saw this in action, something suddenly clicked with me. It was the separation of the build and test build configuration and the deploy build configuration. What this meant is that you can have your Continuous Integration build running which prepares the package ready for deployment (which can run every time you check in some code) and another build configuration which is responsible for doing the actual deployment. Clever!  Paul then when on to discuss what turned into a very hot topic, namely Feature Switching. Paul contends that the strategy of using Feature Branching ultimately leads to a number of time consuming merging of the source code (perhaps not as hard when using Distributed Source Control) which could be avoided with the use of toggling features on and off when required. Having thought about it, and listened to the discussion that came from it, it is hard to argue. For more information on the subject, have a look at Martin Fowlers blog post <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureToggle.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Again, another great session, and I am very much looking forward to tomorrow.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>The second day of the Progressive .Net Tutorials got off to a flying start thanks to Simon Brown (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/simonbrown">@simonbrown</a>) and his “<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/load-testing-for-developers">Load Testing for Developers</a>” session.</p>

<p>First up, I have to give Simon a lot of credit for his preparation for this talk. His <a href="http://www.codingthearchitecture.com/2011/08/25/load_testing_for_developers.html">blog post</a> clearly listed all the requirements for his very interactive session. This included getting the source code for the application that was being tested, the load testing tool (<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/jmeter/">jmeter</a>) that we were going to be exercising, as well as his slide deck.</p>

<p>Interestingly, his slide deck was in the form of an <a href="http://www.evernote.com/">Evernote</a> notebook, which as well as having the standard slides, also had a set of exercises that were to be completed during the course of this presentation. Normally when I am in a session like this, I fire open <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-gb/onenote/">OneNote</a> and take notes in there, but for the sake of this session, I closed OneNote <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Day-2--Morning-Session-prognet11-skillsm_BEDE/wlEmoticon-sadsmile.png" alt="Sad smile" />. I have to say though, I was impressed with Evernote. I don’t think I will being switching any time soon, but it was very good.</p>

<p>Now, onto the actual content of the session….</p>

<p>I have to say that I was very impressed with the session. Now, I have never done any form of Load Testing, and I was worried that in order to do any there would be this convoluted process to put all the pieces in the right place and get it all working, but this is simply not the case.</p>

<p>After a couple setup steps, jmeter was in a position to record the steps of a simple login process to the sample web application.</p>

<p>From there, the rest of the session centred around extending the simple log in test script to include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>more users</p></li>
<li><p>parameterised request</p></li>
<li><p>regular expression extraction of parameters</p></li>
<li><p>running in head less mode</p></li>
<li><p>logging the output of the test to file</p></li>
</ul>


<p>With all of these things in place it is a small jump to see how you could include these into a Continuous Integration cycle, to get immediate feedback on how your site is reacting to the load testing.</p>

<p>Simon did make a distinction between Load Testing and Integration Testing. Although you “could” use jmeter to do rudimentary Integration Testing, there are other tools on the market that do a better job of this, such as <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a> and <a href="http://cukes.info/">Cucumber</a>. The take away from this was use each tool for what it is designed for.</p>

<p>Simon also mentioned that he is away to open source a tool that will help with the parsing of the output from jmeter. I am going to be very interested to see when this is open sourced as I think I am going to make use of jmeter in an upcoming project.</p>

<p>All in all, a great session!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Wow!</p>

<p>Following up on a very interesting <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=361">session this morning</a>, Dylan Beattie (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/dylanbeattie">@dylanbeattie</a>) provided a VERY interesting session called “<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/front-end-tips-for-back-end-devs">Front-End Tips for Back-End Devs</a>”</p>

<p>The session started out with a whistle stop tour of HTML 5 including a pop quiz about new things that are going out. Example pop quiz question:</p>

<blockquote><p>Which of these is NOT an HTML5 element?</p>

<p>&lt;command&gt; &lt;iframe&gt; &lt;ruby&gt; &lt;shortcut&gt; &lt;progress&gt; &lt;time&gt;</p></blockquote>

<p>For the answer, take a look at the following:</p>

<p><a href="http://joshduck.com/periodic-table.html">http://joshduck.com/periodic-table.html</a></p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> At the time of writing this article, the above link contained the Periodic Table, however, it has been pointed out that this link no longer works.  Instead, you can find a similar resource <a href="http://www.websitesetup.org/html5-periodical-table">here</a> from Robert Mening.</p>

<p>Which lists all the current HTML5 elements in the form of a periodic table.</p>

<p>The talk then took a <strong>VERY</strong> interesting turn and started to describe how you could apply the SOLID coding principles to your Web Sites’ CSS.</p>

<p><strong>“S” is for Single Responsibility</strong></p>

<p>Dylan described the concept of taking traditional CSS and turning it inside out. Rather than containing all the styles, for example font, colour, size etc, within a single, specific, CSS definition, instead create a CSS definition that does one thing, for instance, makes “stuff” red. That way, you can apply multiple selectors to this CSS definition to apply the colour red to an element.</p>

<p><strong>“O” is for Open-Closed Principle</strong></p>

<p>Dylan suggested three main rules to follow when applying this principle:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Don’t use !Important</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t use classes</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t use ID’s</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Although, he did concede that in some places, the latter two HAD to be broken.</p>

<p><strong>“L” is for Liskov Substitution</strong></p>

<p>Due to the fact that we (as Web Developers) are restricted in the base types that we can inherit from, there is not much that can be done here in applying this particular principle.</p>

<p><strong>“I” is for Interface Segregation</strong></p>

<p>The example that was provided was that this:</p>

<p>&lt;input class=”tall wide next button” /&gt;</p>

<p>is a lot easier to read and maintain than:</p>

<p>&lt;input class=”tallWideNextButton” /&gt;</p>

<p><strong>“D” is for Dependency Inversion</strong></p>

<p>Although he has tried, Dylan said that there is no direct application of this principle to CSS.</p>

<p>Now, after hearing all of the above, I have to admit that I was a little thrown. It literally goes against everything that I have learnt to date about applying CSS, and it took a while to digest it.</p>

<p>However, after giving it some thought, it does appear to make some sense. I guess it will really only be after I have used this technique in anger that I will be able to make a final decision on whether it makes sense to me.</p>

<p>The session wrapped up with Dylan demonstrating his WebGloss Nuget package. Here he showed how you could create the base styles, master pages, JavaScript etc for a site, package it up into a Nuget package, and then apply this to a blank ASP.Net MVC application. If required, you could then override things that were specific to the new application.</p>

<p>I have to say I really like this approach, and I will be keeping a look out for the final release of WebGloss once Dylan makes it available. HINT: If you could let me know when it is available I would be very grateful <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Day-1Afternoon-Session-prognet11-skillsm_FF94/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" /></p>

<p>In summary, a great session that I would highly recommend you watching back on the Skills Matter site.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>As per my earlier <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=358">blog post</a>, this morning I attended the “<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/patterns-and-practices-of-package-management">Solving the Packaging Puzzle</a>” featuring Ian Cooper (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/icooper">@ICooper</a>) and Sebastian Lambla (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/serialseb">@serialseb</a>).</p>

<p>This talk was split into two parts.</p>

<p>The first was the “theory” behind Packages and this was handled by Ian. This included a description of what a “package” is and how we can write our code in such a way as to lend itself for easier package creation.</p>

<p>The second part of the talk was handled by Sebastian, with a “real world” demo of creating a Web Site (using <a href="http://openrasta.org/">OpenRasta</a>) adding functionality, splitting this functionality into a separate project, packaging the re-usable code and including it in the original Web Site Project. All of this was handled using <a href="http://www.openwrap.org/">OpenWrap</a>.</p>

<p>A lot of the concepts that were described in the first part of the session were not news to me, but they are also not something that I have fully utilised. This is mainly because of my lack of full understanding of how everything pieces together. Ian went into great detail on things like:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Modular Decomposability</p></li>
<li><p>Modular Composability</p></li>
<li><p>Modular Continuity</p></li>
<li><p>Modular Protection</p></li>
<li><p>Direct Mapping</p></li>
<li><p>Few Interfaces</p></li>
<li><p>Small Interfaces</p></li>
<li><p>SOLID code principles
And how these can be used to ensure that the code base is constructed property.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>These are all topics that I have heard about, but never fully put into practice. If nothing else, this morning talk has highlighted that I “need” to read up on these topics. Ian has recommended two books:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0136291554/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0136291554">Object-Oriented Software Construction</a></p>

<p>and</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0131857258/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0131857258">Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C#</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=0131857258" alt="" /></p>

<p>Which I am going to have to add to my growing list of books that I have to read.</p>

<p>I got a lot out of the “refactoring” that Sebastian showed in his demonstration of how you can put all the theory into practice. And although the demonstration didn’t go as “smoothly” as I think Sebastian would have liked, for me, it really did hammer the point home.</p>

<p>I have never used OpenWrap, only Nuget. I would be interested to hear from anyone who has used both. Likes? Disklikes? etc.</p>

<p>All in all, a very good start to the Progressive .Net Tutorials, and I am looking forward to the remaining five sessions.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>In a recent <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=313">blog post</a> I spoke about how we (as developers) all have to strive to become a “better developer”. From a personal stand point, I decided that I was going to try to attend the <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event/open-source-dot-net/progressive-dot-net-tutorials-2011">Progressive .Net Tutorials</a>, because in my opinion, the sessions were just too good to miss. After making this decision, I heard a rumour that Paul Stack (one of the speakers at the Tutorials) was in a position to <a href="http://www.paulstack.co.uk/blog/post/win-a-ticket-to-progressivenet-tutorials.aspx">give away two tickets to the event</a>.</p>

<p>On the off chance that I might win, I decided to drop an email to Paul, basically reciting what I had said in my blog post, and luckily for me, I won!!! <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/wlEmoticon-smile1.png" alt="Smile" /></p>

<p>I have now booked the hotel and flights for getting down there, and I have to say that I am really looking forward to the event. The only real problem now is deciding which sessions I want to attend.</p>

<p>First up “<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/defining-acceptance-criteria-in-gherkin">Gherking Acceptance Criteria</a>” or “<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/patterns-and-practices-of-package-management">Solving the Packaging Puzzle</a>”. Having given it a lot of thought, I am thinking that “Solving the Packaging Puzzle” is going to get my vote.</p>

<p>Next up “<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/coming-soon-2032">Automating Gherkin Acceptance Criteria with Specflow</a>” or “<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/front-end-tips-for-back-end-devs">Front-end Tips for Back-end Devs</a>”. Although I have heard a lot of good things about Specflow and it is on my list of things to look into, I think I am going to get more out of the “Front-end Tips for Back-end Devs” talk.</p>

<p>Moving onto the second day, we have the choice between “<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/load-testing-for-developers">Load Testing for Developers</a>” or “<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/test-driven-development-in-javascript">Test-driven Development in JavaScript</a>”. This is a tough for me, they both sound like great sessions. For now, I think I am leaning more towards the “Load Testing for Developers” session, but I might change my mind.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of the second day we have “<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/ci-to-cd">Continuous Integration to Continuous Delivery</a>” and “<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/advanced-websharper-tutorial-2359">Advanced WebSharper Tutorial</a>”. I think this one is an easier decision. I have a keen interest in Continuous Integration. At work we are already using a system of CI to automate the creation of a build package that we can deploy to a server, but I am interested to hear how we can take this to the next step and implement Continuous Delivery.</p>

<p>First up on the third day we have “<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/restful-web-service-development-in-dot-net">RESTful Web Service Development in .NET</a>” or “<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/async-methods-in-c-sharp-5-2389">Async Methods in C# 5</a>”. For me, I think the obvious choice has to be “Async Methods in C# 5”. I have read up on a few things that are shipping with C# 5, and to see some of these in action should be very interesting.</p>

<p>The final session in the Progressive .Net Tutorials is the choice between “<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/introduction-to-nancy-and-simple-data">Introduction to Nancy and Simple.Data</a>” and “<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/you-think-you-know-agile">You Think You Know Agile?</a>”. Again, this is a tough call for me. Part of me wants to learn something new, and Nancy and Simple.Data fit that bill perfectly, but it would also be good to concrete some of the stuff I “think” I know about Agile. I am still making a decision on this one, might come down to the day of the talk to actually make a decision.</p>

<p>I am not clear on how the sessions are being handled, and how potential “over-crowding” of a session is going to be handled, but hopefully I will be able to attend my first choice sessions. If not, I am sure I will still get a lot from the others.</p>

<p>Are you going to the Progressive .Net Tutorials? Have you decided which sessions you want to attend?</p>

		<p>I don’t know about you, but I am the kind of person that when I am thinking things through, I have to be “playing” with something.</p>

<p>If I am in front of the whiteboard, this normally ends with me doodling a picture, as I am the kind of person who thinks in pictures. If not in front of the whiteboard, I normally end up twirling a pen in my fingers. I find that this type of thing helps me concentrate, and focus on the problem at end. Although, I am aware that this can be slightly annoying to some of my colleagues, so there are times when make a conscious effort of trying to not do it.</p>

However, I found that these could be quite noisy, and distracting for other people in the office, so I have had to put these away.</p>

<p>Enter the new contender to the “mind focusing” realm….</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B004F86J76/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B004F86J76"><img src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.co.uk/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;Format=_SL110_&amp;ASIN=B004F86J76&amp;MarketPlace=GB&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822" alt="" /></a>A set of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B004F86J76/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B004F86J76">Magnetic Neodymium Cube Puzzle Balls</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B004F86J76" alt="" />. 216 separate magnetic balls that when constructed in the correct way form a perfect 6x6 cube.</p>

<p>I was introduced to these from a colleague at work, who also has a set. My Project Manager can’t understand why, but I find these very useful on a day to day basis, both in terms of focusing the mind, as well as a stress relief mechanism. The 216 balls can also be formed into a string, and as I am thinking about a problem I find myself working these around my hands. In addition, taking a couple minutes away from a problem to form the 6x6 cube helps to de-stress.</p>

<p>If like me to need to be “playing” with something to help you think, I would highly recommend these.</p>
