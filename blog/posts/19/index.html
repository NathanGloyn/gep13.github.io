		<p>_This is the second in a <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=53">series of blog posts</a> I’m doing on the features that I now find invaluable within Microsoft OneNote 2010. _</p>

<p><strong>The Situation:</strong></p>

<p>Sitting at your computer, you are happily coding away on your project and you get a visit from your project manager, and he is pissed!!! You are not expecting him, and you are not ready for the barrage of questions that he is throwing at you. You need time to think, so you ask to have a meeting with him later that day, to which he says <em>“That’s fine, but make sure you have all the information that I asked for!!!”</em></p>

<p><strong>The Problem:</strong></p>

<p>Due to the fact that you were completely unprepared for this impromptu meeting, you didn’t write down any notes from the discussion that you just had, and you are now struggling to remember everything that was asked of you. Since your manager was pissed, you can’t really go and ask him to recap the questions that he asked of you (well, <em>yes</em>, you could, and that is actually what you would do, but let me try to illustrate my point). You should have started writing things down as he started asking them but you can never find any paper when you need it, and your pen never works!! Argh!!</p>

<p><strong>The OneNote Solution:</strong></p>

<p>Once OneNote is up installed on your machine, it is always available, for any application. Simply by pressing the “Windows Key + N” you will be presented with an area into which you can start writing notes, shown here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image3.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb3.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>This isn’t the full OneNote application, but rather a stripped down version of it, with some rudimentary formatting options, and a space to start entering text. As a result, it opens almost immediately, and you can literally start typing directly into it.</p>

<p>To follow on from the situation above, as your manager is harassing you with questions, you can quickly jot down some notes from the discussion, and then expand on them later, once he has gone.</p>

<p>Everything you type into this note is saved straight away, with no need for you to do anything else, just type the text, and then close the note. To get the note back later, fire open OneNote, and you will see a section called “Unfiled Notes” at the bottom left hand side:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image4.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb4.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>This is where all your “quick” notes end up. The idea being that you either delete them once you are finished with them, or you add them into one of your other Notebooks or sections.</p>

<p>So, the next time you see your Manager storming your way, all you need to do are two things…</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Hit “Windows Key + M” – you don’t want him to see you sitting with Twitter or FaceBook open</p></li>
<li><p>Hit “Windows Key + N” – ready to start writing notes for the discussion you are about to have.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Hope this helps!</p>

		<p><em>This is the first in a </em><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=53"><em>series of blog posts</em></a><em> I’m doing on the features that I now find invaluable within Microsoft OneNote 2010.</em></p>

<p><strong>The Situation:</strong></p>

<p>At work we use SharePoint to store pretty much all of our Project Documents. This includes the use of Blogs, Wikis, Document Libraries, Lists, Sites, Site Collections, and Technical Discussion Boards to capture all of the day to day information about a Project.</p>

<p>When it comes to finding an error, or tracking down a problem within a particular piece of software, I want to capture the run up to the problem, the steps to reproduce it, screenshots, attempts to fix, the resolution, etc., so that if it happens again, I would be able to remember what I did before.</p>

<p>9 times out of 10, this would end up as an internal blog post which I could search at a later date to look up the problem.</p>

<p><strong>The Problem:</strong></p>

<p>As with most software problems, you typically get some sort of error message…</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p><em>Here is one I created earlier….</em></p>

<p>In order to be useful, and searchable, I would normally type out the entire contents of the error message into the blog post, so that when it happens again, I can take the text from the error message and search for it directly within my blog. Sounds simple right? Now, imagine that you have a very long error message, or perhaps a stack trace included within the prompt. Typing all this out by hand can be quite tedious.</p>

<p><strong>The OneNote Solution:</strong></p>

<p>By default, when you insert an image into a OneNote Note, the text within that picture (if there is any) is automatically made searchable. You can verify this by right clicking on the image and looking at “Make Text in Image Searchable”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image1.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb1.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>From within this menu you have the option of turning this feature off, as well as selecting the language that you want to use for the text recognition.</p>

<p>When it comes to searching for the text of interest, just hit “CTRL+F”, type the text you want, and then click through the results:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image2.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb2.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>In the above, notice how the text that was searched for in the top right hand corner immediately became highlighted within the image that had been pasted into the Note.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Following an introduction to Microsoft OneNote 2007 by a colleague at work, I find myself using OneNote more and more things within my work day. Taking minutes of meetings, writing ToDo lists, capturing information about products that I am using, bugs that I am finding, etc. There are so many things that OneNote “just does”, that I now find invaluable.</p>

<p>Now, thanks to the Microsoft Home Use Program I am the proud owner of Microsoft Office Professional 2010, including OneNote 2010, and I now find myself using OneNote both at home, and on my Windows Phone 7.</p>

<p>This post is going to be the parent post for a series of posts where I am going to describe the features that I have come to rely on within OneNote 2010 (some of these features are not going to be specific to OneNote 2010, they may have existed within earlier versions, but any screenshots and descriptions that are provided will be based on OneNote 2010).</p>

<p>I will update this page with links to the individual posts I do as I publish them:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=60">Number 1 – Make Text in Image Searchable</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=69">Number 2 – Create a note from anywhere</a></p>

<p>Hope you find these features as useful as I have!</p>

		<p><em>NOTE: I am not advocating the illegal ripping of DVDs.  Every DVD that I rip onto my server I own, and I am simply using this approach to make the watching of DVDs easier across the various TVs and computers that I have in my house.</em></p>

<p>Since getting my <a href="http://www.synology.com/us/products/ds410/index.php">Synology Server</a> (which I LOVE, by the way), I have been wondering about how I can “rip” DVDs onto this server, which I could then watch downstairs on my PS3.  I did some searching, and everything I found seemed overly complicated, and the ones that I tried ended up not working correctly.</p>

<p>However, after talking to a few colleagues, and some additional searching, I found the following two packages:</p>

<p><strong>MakeMKV:</strong> <a href="http://www.makemkv.com/">http://www.makemkv.com/</a></p>

<p><strong>PS3Muxer:</strong> <a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=148627">http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=148627</a></p>

<p>The first package does the job of “ripping” the actual audio and video content from the DVD/Blu-Ray onto your computer, and placing it into a MKV container.  I was sort of hoping that this one action was going to be enough to stream the content to the PS3, however, the MKV format is not supported on the PS3.</p>

<p>As a result, a second step is required, and this is where PS3Muxer steps in.  It takes the MKV container (.mkv), and translates it into a .m2ts file, which is possible to stream to the PS3.</p>

<p>Personally, I would prefer that this was a one step action, rather than two, but for now, I am happy to do this “extra” step.</p>

<p>If anyone has got any thoughts on a better approach to the above, then I would be very interested to hear about it.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/using-a-bit-ly-pro-account/" itemprop="url">Use a bit.ly Pro Account to Shorten Url&#8217;s With a Custom Domain</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I recently found out (thanks @stack72) that it was possible to register for a bit.ly pro account, which would allow you to set up a custom short domain for shortening url&rsquo;s in things like twitter and blogs posts.</p>

<p>You might have seen this in the links that the likes that Scott Hanselman uses, for instance <a href="http://hnsl.mn/...">http://hnsl.mn/&#8230;</a>  He specifically registered the domain hnsl.mn (which is his last name without the vowels).  Whenever he adds a link to a tweet, the full url gets shortened and uses his base custom domain to identify that it came from him.</p>

<p>When I first saw this, I thought that you would have to pay for the privilege, but that is not the case (aside from the initial cost of the purchase of the domain that is).</p>

<p>The steps are fairly simple, and break down like this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Purchase your custom short domain.  Personally, I went for gep13.me</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://bit.ly/a/pro_request">Register for a bit.ly pro account</a></p></li>
<li><p>Once the registration completes, and is authorised, you will have access to configure your custom domain</p></li>
<li><p>You will be prompted to change the A record for your domain to point at the bit.ly servers</p></li>
<li><p>Once you have done that, you will have to verify these settings (you will like need to wait a while, like I did, for the DNS change to filter through the DNS servers across the world, before bit.ly can see it)</p></li>
<li><p>With that in place, you can configure the Dashboard Tracking Domain that you want to use, for me, I just used my own domain</p></li>
<li><p>Then, you are all set, all you need to do after that is configure your favourite package to use it.  Again, for me, this is Seesmic, and all I had to do here is take the bit.ly API Key from within bit.ly and paste it into Seesmic</p></li>
</ol>


<p>From now on, any link that I shorten through Seesmic will always start with gep13.me.</p>

<p>Simples!</p>

		<p>I have just entered my first VBForums Photography contest. This is the seventh of these events, but this is the first time that I have felt that I have some decent enough photos that I could enter into it.

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>In all honesty, I wasn’t sure what to expect from DDD9.</p>

<p>I had heard from a few people that it was a great event, and that they had learnt a lot from attending the previous years, but if I am honest, I was a little dubious about going.</p>

<p>The main reason for this was the distance that I had to travel to get there.  Hailing from north of the border (Aberdeen) meant that I had to get a plane to Heathrow, then a bus to Reading and then a walk to the hotel, all in all, a bit of a trek for a completely unknown event.</p>

<p>However, after reading the session synopsis’s on the developerdeveloperdeveloper.com website, I decided that there was enough interesting sessions that would make the trip worthwhile.</p>

<p>So, what was the result?</p>

<p><strong>It was an AMAZING event! </strong></p>

<p>Sorry for shouting <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" /></p>

<p>I have to give a lot of respect to the organisers, they put on a phenomenal event.  I can’t imagine how much work they had to do in terms of organisers speakers, etc.  Congratulations!!  I have to say a big thank you also to Microsoft for providing the venue and the catering.</p>

<p>So, how did the day break down for me?</p>

<p><strong>At the hotel</strong></p>

<p>I had thought that I would get one of the coaches (supplied by DevExpress) to Thames Valley Park, however, once I arrived at the Reading Central Premier Inn, I checked Twitter, and I saw a shout out from @philpursglove saying that he had space in his car, so I asked if I could get a lift, and I was told yes, woot!</p>

<p>However, when morning came, and I couldn’t see any fellow geeks in the hotel lobby, I started to get a bit worried (bear in mind I hadn’t met Phil before) and I started wondering if Phil was perhaps staying at a different Premier Inn, as I hadn’t actually confirmed which one he was staying at, oops!</p>

<p>I started thinking that I should head for the coach instead as I didn’t want to have to try to catch a taxi.  A quick text to @stack72 informed me that @nathangloyn was also staying at this Premier Inn (someone else I hadn’t met before), and within a few minutes Nathan had met me in the lobby, and I gratefully accepted the offer of his lift to Thames Valley Park (sorry to mess you around @philpursglove)</p>

<p><strong>In the car/Arrival at Thames Valley Park</strong></p>

<p><em>Note to Google Maps:</em></p>

<p><em>Please update your map information for Reading Town Centre, as I think there have been some road works since you last did it!!</em></p>

<p>After ignoring Google Navigation on Nathan’s HTC Desire, we managed to find our way to the Microsoft Offices in Thames Valley Park.  Having never been there before, I was blown away at the scale of the buildings, they were huge!</p>

<p>We were directed to Building 3, and parked up.  On entering the building, we were issued with our name badges, and Nathan went to meet the other speakers (he was giving a talk in the afternoon on S.O.L.I.D, which wasn’t on my list of sessions to see, oops!  Sorry Nathan).  I was then directed into the main waiting area, between the Chicago 1 and 2 meeting rooms, where I was told that there was bacon rolls and drinks (why did I have breakfast at the hotel?!?  <em>Note to self, don’t do this if you go back next year!</em>).</p>

<p>Within this area there was a book stand, and further round the corner there was a Kinect for use by the delegates.  Watching full grown geeks jumping about in front of what must of been, at least, a 50” screen was quite amusing!!  Back to the book stand, which was offering a 25% discount on all books, meant that I had to buy some.  I bought two books, one of Windows Phone 7 and the other on MSBuild, Both from Microsoft Press.  A bit of light reading for the plane home.</p>

<p>I had arrived reasonably early, which meant that the hall wasn’t that busy, but it quickly filled up, and it got to the point that you couldn’t move.  This is a VERY popular event!!</p>

<p><strong>Session 1 - AJAX with jQuery (@GeorgeAdamson)</strong></p>

<p>Wow!!!</p>

<p>Having read the description of this talk:</p>

<p><em>“George&rsquo;s presentation style is entertaining and leaps along at quite a rate. (If you&rsquo;ve attended George&rsquo;s Get Going with JQuery session then you have an idea what you&rsquo;re in for.) “</em></p>

<p>I knew I was in for something quite different, but I wasn’t prepared for what I got.  George is an amazing presenter, and he quickly draws you into the topic, his enthusiasm for the topic is addictive!!  There was a “slight” malfunction near the start, where his first demonstration didn’t want to work properly, but by the end of the talk, this had been completely forgotten.  I have used a small amount of jQuery in the past, but never sunk my teeth into it.  The demonstrations that were given (Closures, Hijax, JSON, JSONP, AJAX Tabs), cemented in my mind that this is something that I need to look into!!</p>

<p>Quote of the session from George:</p>

<p><em>“Your non-techy user has just let out a little bit of wee….”</em></p>

<p><strong>Session 2 - Real World Application Development with NHibernate, FluentNHibernate and Castle Windsor (@chriscanal)</strong></p>

<p>I was really looking forward to this presentation.  I have had a presentation on NHibernate before, but I have never used either FluentNHibernate or Castle Windsor, and to see a presentation on these in the context of an ASP.Net MVC Application (another area of interest to me), it sounded perfect!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, after the session, I am still no clearer on what these technologies are, and why I would use them.  Chris is obviously well versed in this area, and I don’t question his knowledge, however for me, it didn’t come over very well.  We jumped straight into a full blown project, with reference to interfaces and containers that I had never heard of, with little or no explanation as to what each of these tools would be doing for us.  Now it might just have been my lack of knowledge that prevented me getting anything out of this session, and people already familiar with all of these tools might have got a lot from it, but the session description made no indication that prior knowledge of these tools would be required.  If this is what is assumed, then it should be made clear in the description.</p>

<p><strong>Session 3 - Writing Maintainable Tests for Selenium (@automatedtester)</strong></p>

<p>Overall, a very interesting session!  Having never seen an automated web application testing framework in action, I was very curious to see one in action, and how you would actually go about writing tests for your site.  The short answer is that it is VERY easy, and I don’t see any reason why it can’t be done, on even small applications.  Selenium is definitely something that I will be looking into going forward, although, given the Silverlight applications that I am currently helping to develop, we might need to find an alternative framework, as Selenium can’t automate tests for a Silverlight application.</p>

<p>The trick to writing the tests is to separate the work of spinning up Selenium, and automating the page, from the logic of the actual unit test.  This is achieved through the use to the Page Object model, means that you can essentially abstract your unit tests away from the work of automating the web page.</p>

<p>The one thing that I think was missing from this presentation would have been to actually see the unit tests being run.  From what I understand, the presenter had assumed that there would be internet access at the presentation.  Since there wasn’t, he wasn’t able to spin up the tests.</p>

<p><strong>Session 4 - What&rsquo;s New in ASP.NET MVC 2.0 &amp; 3.0 (@argibson)</strong></p>

<p>ASP.Net MVC is an area of interest for me.  I last time I looked at it though was when it first came out, back at MVC 1.0, and I was very interested to see what improvements have been made with the release of ASP.Net MVC 3.0.</p>

<p>I am happy to say that the presenter delivered in this regard.  He clearly described the key differences, and after his demonstration of the Razor engine, I think I could happily jump into an MVC application.  Previously I hadn’t “liked” the Web Forms View Engine within ASP.Net MVC.  The presenter mentioned that he will be building on his MVC Demos application, which is available on his blog:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.andy-gibson.co.uk">www.andy-gibson.co.uk</a></p>

<p>And I will be interested in looking at this as it develops.</p>

<p><strong>Session 5 - Enforcing Code &lsquo;Beauty&rsquo; with StyleCop (@guysmithferrier)</strong></p>

<p>Within my company, we are actually already using StyleCop, and I fully advocate the use of it.  The reason that I went along to this talk was to see if there were any aspects of it that we weren’t currently using, and I am happy to say that I did pick up some interesting information.  Guy’s presentation style is VERY good, and he was able to get his point across very well, with lots of laughs along the way.  He basically started out by pointing out all the things that are “wrong” with StyleCop, and then ended by explaining how all of these things can be alleviated, and how you can get up and running with StyleCop today, without any impact from legacy systems.</p>

<p>Things of interest from the talk:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The ExcludeStyleCop executable which can be used to exclude all the class files within a *.csproj file from being looked at by StyleCop</p></li>
<li><p>The idea of having a “StyleCop Friday Afternoon”, where at the end of a long week, you get developers to wind down by picking a class file which hasn’t been “StyleCop’ed” and they set about making it so.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Overall though, a most enjoyable session, thanks Guy!
<strong>Session 6 - Beginners Guide to Continuous Integration (@stack72)</strong></p>

<p>When you consider that this was only Paul’s second or third time at doing this presentation (and his first time with some a big audience), you have to give him a lot of credit!  He did a VERY good job!!</p>

<p>His knowledge and enthusiasm for the subject matter came through very well, and like the first session I attended, addictive.  I have come away from the talk eager to look into what I can put in place within my company to improve on our “Continuous Delivery”.</p>

<p>In house, we currently use TFS for both Source Control and Automated Builds, but having seen a demonstration of TeamCity, I think we could easily switch to start to use this.  That might be a bit of a hard sell, and we will have to get buy in, but I will give it a try.</p>

<p>When I think about tying in the concepts of deployment, with the possibility of Selenium testing, I can start quickly seeing how integration problems and bugs can be quickly identified.</p>

<p><strong>Geek Dinner – Pizza Express</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Food – check!</p></li>
<li><p>Beer – check!</p></li>
<li><p>Interesting conversation – check!</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Enough said.</p>

<p><strong>Overall Thoughts of DDD9</strong></p>

<p>Amazing!!  Well worth making the trip down to Reading, and I would happily attend events in the future.  That is, if I can get a place.  The popularity of this event, means that places for this event were grabbed up very quickly (within something like 12 minutes this year).</p>

<p>Congratulations again to all the organisers, you did a great job, and you should be very proud!!</p>

<p>I am looking forward to hopefully attending DDD Scotland later this year.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Many, many, years ago, when I first started doing programming, as a paid capacity, I stumbled across a website called Coding4Fun. It had a huge array of sample applications including useful things such as a Network Utility for pinging every address on your subnet to find out if there is a device using that IP Address, to fun applications such as an application to take over a person’s auto correction options in Microsoft Office Applications (this was intended as an April Fools prank). I was subscribed to this site for a long time, and enjoyed reading the articles that were posted, and many useful code samples.</p>

<p>Then, all of a sudden, this site dropped of the radar, and I couldn’t find it anywhere. For whatever reason, the site had to be transitioned to merge with something else, and from then on, I didn’t re-subscribe to the site in it’s new home.</p>

<p>I am happy to say that the Coding4Fun site has now found a new home, within the Channel9 site. You can find it here:</p>

<p><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/coding4fun">http://channel9.msdn.com/coding4fun</a></p>

<p>They seem to have been able to transition a lot of the existing posts over to this new home, although, unfortunately, some of the original source code is now missing. I actually downloaded a lot of the original source code while I was subscribed to the original site, and I have tried to let the Coding4Fun administrators know this, but as yet, no one has been in touch with me.</p>

<p>If any knows the admins of this site, please let me know, so that I can pass this code back if they would like it.</p>
