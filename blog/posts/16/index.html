		<p>There are now only 5 sleeps until I start my travel down to <a href="http://www.dddsouthwest.com/">DDD South West</a>!!</p>

<p><strong><em>Looking forward to the day</em></strong></p>

<p>I debated for a long time as to whether I was actually going to attend this event, but in the end I decided that there were just too many good <a href="http://www.dddsouthwest.com/Agenda/tabid/55/Default.aspx">sessions</a> to pass up on. As is always the case though, there are just too many to pick from, and a number of the ones that I was hoping to see are on at the same time, so I might try to catch them in the Repeat Track. The Repeat Track is not something that I have seen at the other DDD events, and I am very curious to see how it works out.</p>

<p><strong><em>Getting there</em></strong></p>

<p>Rather naively, I thought that getting to Bristol was as easy as getting to London, and I left the organisation of the hotel and travel to the last minute (two weeks ago). When I came to try to book travel I was shocked by how much a flight was going to cost. It was going to cost something like £350-400 to get from Aberdeen to Bristol, and Train’s were not much better. As good as the sessions were, travel costs of that much was a bit steep and I started to wonder whether I was going to be able to make it at all.</p>

<p>Then I spoke to Craig (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/camurphy">@camurphy</a>) and Colin (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/colinmackay">@ColinMackay</a>) and found out that they were planning on driving down, so I asked if I could grab a lift, and luckily for me, they said that I could. As the driver, Craig did mention that he would have to:</p>

<blockquote>  
> 
>    
> 
> adopt a RyanAir baggage policy
> 
>    
> 
> </blockquote>


<p>Sorted! So, now all I have to do is travel down to meet Craig for the first leg of the journey to DDD South West.</p>

<p><strong><em>Windows Phone 7 Application</em></strong></p>

<p>In case you haven’t seen it, there is a Windows Phone 7 application for DDD South West (you can find it in the Marketplace by searching for “DDD SW 2011”.</p>

<p>The original version of this application simply listed any tweets on twitter that included the #dddsw hash tag, however, a recent update to the application now includes the agenda for the day. Screenshots below:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/DSCF5118.jpg"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/DSCF5118_thumb.jpg" alt="DSCF5118" /></a><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/DSCF5117.jpg"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/DSCF5117_thumb.jpg" alt="DSCF5117" /></a></p>

<p>I for one will be making extensive use of this application when I am trying to decide which sessions I want to go to.</p>

<p><strong><em>Helping out</em></strong></p>

<p>I have also volunteered to help out at this years DDD South West. I don’t know what exactly this will mean on the day, but I am sure that Guy Smith-Ferrier (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/GuySmithFerrier">@GuySmithFerrier</a>) will keep me right.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/follow-up-from-adnuguk-refactoring-meeting/" itemprop="url">Follow Up From ADNUGUK Refactoring Meeting</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>On Thursday 26th May, the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group was fortunate enough to welcome <a href="http://garyshort.org/">Gary Short</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/garyshort">@garyshort</a>) of <a href="http://www.devexpress.com/">DevExpress</a> to do a talk entitled “<a href="http://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Meetings/Refactoring-%E2%80%93-Everything-you-Wanted-to-Know-but-we.aspx">Refactoring – Everything you wanted to know but were afraid to ask</a>”.</p>

<p>If you were not able to attend the session you can find the slide deck from the presentation <a href="http://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/files/Meeting-Presentations/RefactoringDeepDive.aspx">here</a>, big thanks to Gary for giving us a copy of the slide deck.</p>

<p>The presentation was very well received and I am happy to say that outside of the <a href="http://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Meetings/What-s-New-in-Silverlight-4-.aspx">Microsoft event</a>, which we held back in November last year, attendance was the highest that it has ever been!!</p>

<p>The User Group now has over 75 registered members, and attendance at our meetings is averaging around the 20 people mark, which is far better than I ever thought it would be an I started out in this little adventure, so I wanted to take this opportunity to say thank you to everyone who has been coming along! The User Group really would be nothing without you guys coming along!</p>

<p>As I mentioned on the night, I am planning on increasing the frequency of the meetings for the User Group. I have decided this for a number of reasons.</p>

<p>Firstly, I have had a lot of interest from speakers who would like to do talks at the User Group, and the bi-monthly cycle meant that I would have to put some speakers off until next year, which isn’t great.</p>

<p>Secondly, I think that a more regular meeting cycle keeps up the level of interest. Based on the show of hands by the attendees on the night, as well as speaking to some other Group Leaders, a regular monthly slot seems to make a lot of sense. If for some reason it doesn’t work for this User Group, then we can easily switch back.</p>

<p>Now, having just spoken about a regular monthly slot, (aiming for the 3rd Thursday of every month), I am going to have to break that rule for the first month. <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" /></p>

<p>I was planning on starting this month, June, but the first speaker was not able to make it, and as a result, we are now going to have two meetings in July.</p>

<p>The first up is <a href="http://www.kodefuguru.com/">Chris Eargle</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/kodefuguru">@KodefuGuru</a>), a Telerik Developer Evangelist from Columbia, South Carolina, who, while over here to do other talks in the UK, is going to stop by Aberdeen and do a talk entitled “<a href="http://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Meetings/Secrets-of-a--Net-Ninja.aspx">Secrets of a .Net Ninja</a>”.</p>

<p>Next up is <a href="http://paulstack.co.uk/blog/">Paul Stack</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/stack72">@stack72</a>) a Continuous Integration enthusiast, that is going to travel up to Aberdeen to do a talk entitled “<a href="http://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Meetings/Beginners-Guide-to-CI.aspx">Beginners Guide to CI</a>”.</p>

<p>I am very much looking forward to both of these talks, and I hope that you will be able to make it along on the night.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>As some of you may have noticed, I have switched from using the #ADNUG hash tag to using #ADNUGUK on Twitter. This is due to the fact that there was a clash with the <a href="http://www.adnug.org/">Austin Dot Net User Group</a>, as well as the <a href="http://www.adnug.com/">Adelaide Dot Net User Group</a>, so if you are ever mentioning the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group can I ask you to use #ADNUGUK.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I have just seen on Twitter via <a href="http://www.twitter.com/#!/Plip">@Plip</a> that <a href="http://www.weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/">Scott Guthrie</a> (aka <a href="http://www.twitter.com/#!/scottgu">@scottgu</a>) will be coming to London on the 6th June 2011. Full details of the event can be found here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/gulon2/">http://www.developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/gulon2/</a></p>

<p>I went to the <a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/guglas/">Glasgow Guathan</a> back in March 2010 just after Visual Studio 2010 and ASP.Net 4.0 had been released and I have to say that it was a very good event!! An entire day of learning from, quite literally, the guy who helped build ASP.Net, with the ability to ask questions as well, is just amazing!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I don’t think I will be able to make it down to this event this time, but I would highly recommend that you attend if you can.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/configure-dns-settings-for-office-365/" itemprop="url">Configure DNS Settings for Office 365</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>For the last few weeks I have been trying to sort of my installation of the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/online-software.aspx">Office 365 Beta</a>. I am not a business, but the Beta is open to individuals as well as corporate people. There are several reasons that I wanted to play with it:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Sheer curiosity. I heard a lot about it while I was at the <a href="http://www.sharepointbestpractices.co.uk/">BPCUK conference</a></p></li>
<li><p>Wanted to try out the full integration experience with Windows Phone 7</p></li>
<li><p>Try out some sandboxed SharePoint solutions</p></li>
<li><p>Set up a meeting place for the administrators of the <a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/">Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>When you get your invite to the Beta you will be asked to hand over a domain to Office 365 to take over the administration of. The majority of the time, that shouldn’t really be a problem as the domain that you are likely to want to host on Office 365 will be a dedicated one for that purpose, however, if like me you use the domain for other stuff, or you administer your own DNS settings, you won’t want to hand over the domain to their control.</p>

<p>Although not mentioned when you first log into the Office 365 setup page, you are able to configure the DNS settings yourself, the end result is that the domain entries simply point to Office 365, rather than being under their direct control.</p>

<p>Now, before we go too much further, let me state that I actually know very little about setting up DNS entries, and it was only through the help of <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ianmoran">@ianmoran</a> that I was actually able to get mine working.</p>

<p><em>NOTE: Ian has a post </em><a href="http://www.konnexion.com/?p=177"><em>here</em></a><em> that I used as an aid to get up and running</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Required DNS Records</strong></em></p>

<p>In order to know the DNS settings that you need to configure you have to log into the administration section of Office 365. Once in there, click on Admin. From there, click on Domains in the left hand menu, then click on the domain that you want to administer. Once there, click on DNS Manager, and you will see something like the following:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image4.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image_thumb4.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>These are all the records that you will need to configure on your domain. The first set are used for the Exchange Email and the second set are used of setting up <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/mssmallbiz/archive/2010/11/16/microsoft-lync-2010-information-and-resources-for-you.aspx">Lync 2010</a>.</p>

<p>If like me, you will be able to set up the majority of these records without too much trouble. It is just a case of logging into your hosting provider and adding the records. I did this without any problems through <a href="http://www.blacknight.com/">Blacknight’s</a> control panel for the MX, CNAME and TXT records.</p>

<p>However, when it came to the SRV records, I was stumped. I had never heard of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRV_record">SRV</a> (Service Record) before, and through the Blacknight control panel it appeared that I was only able to create the <em>tcp protocol record, there was no option to create a </em>tls protocol record. A quick email to the support team confirmed this, but I was told that they would be able to create the record on my behalf, phew!</p>

<p>With all the records created, I set about testing it. The Exchange email started working straight away, both through Outlook on the desktop, Webmail on the Internet, and through Outlook on my Windows Phone 7. Success!!</p>

<p>However, when it came to Lync 2010, I just couldn’t get it to work!</p>

<p><strong><em>Manual Lync 2010 Configuration</em></strong></p>

<p>With the help of Ian, I was able to set up Lync 2010 manually, to prove that it worked at all. This was done by going into Lync and selecting Tools | Options, and from there click “Advanced…”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image5.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image_thumb5.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>Then, in the Advanced Connection Settings dialogue, manually configure the internal and external server names to be sipdir.online.lync.com:443:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image6.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image_thumb6.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>And this will allow you to log into Lync using your user that you set up in Office 365.</p>

<p><strong><em>Testing SRV Records</em></strong></p>

<p>Although manually settings the records was “fine” I wanted to figure out what was wrong with my set up. In order to do that, I had to figure out what the records were set up as. The feedback that I was getting from Blacknight was that everything was fine on their end, but I had no way of verifying that. I had a report that they were using <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/dig">dig</a> to confirm the records, however, I don’t have a linux server to use that command, and even though I installed the Windows version of <a href="http://members.shaw.ca/nicholas.fong/dig/">dig</a>, I just couldn’t get it to work.</p>

<p>I fell back on trying to use nslookup to get the information that I needed, and I was finally able to figure out how to do this.</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Start | run</p></li>
<li><p> Type cmd then press enter</p></li>
<li><p> Type nslookup and then press enter</p></li>
<li><p> Type set type=srv and then press enter</p></li>
<li><p> Type <em>sip.</em>tls.<your domain name here> and press enter</p></li>
<li><p> You will then get the record back</p></li>
<li><p> Type <em>sipfederationtls.</em>tcp.<your domain name here> and press enter</p></li>
<li><p> You will then get your record back</p></li>
</ol>


<p>The output should look something like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/SRV-Records.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/SRV-Records_thumb.png" alt="SRV Records" /></a></p>

<p><em>NOTE: There records are the ones that are misconfigured</em></p>

<p>Now, when I looked at this, I thought everything looked ok, when compared to the above screen shot for the DNS Manager settings within Office 365. However, when I showed this to Ian, who must have a keener eye than me, he told me that the _tls entry was incorrect. Notice how the svr hostname is appended with .aberdeendevelopers.co.uk? That is incorrect. Turns out that the SRV record which had been entered by Blacknight was missing a trailing period, which meant that the domain name was getting appended. I didn’t realise setting up DNS entries was this complicated!!</p>

<p>Another quick email to Blacknight support cleared up this problem, and I was then able to connect to Lync 2010, win!</p>

		<p>Ok, that is clearly a little bit of an exaggeration, I haven’t automated my whole house, but I have automated a very small portion of it. What am I talking about? And why am I writing a blog about it? Read on, and all will be revealed :)</p>

<p>Last weekend while I was at <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=210">DDD Scotland</a> I got talking to <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/richardadalton">@richardadalton</a> and during an enthralling conversation about the Commodore 64 (I really think I want to fire up my old C64, but I am worried about whether it would blow up cause it’s so old. I could always get myself one of <a href="http://www.commodoreusa.net/CUSA_C64.aspx">these</a> though), I got a phone call from my wife asking if I would “switch of the internet”, to which I responded with, “sure, no problem”, and I promptly did so.</p>

<p>Now bear in mind, I was 150 miles away at the time. How did I do this? Using my Windows Phone 7 of course!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image3.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image_thumb3.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>I should clarify that in my house, switching off the internet actually translates as switching off the wireless antenna of our ADSL Router. The need to do this stems from the fact that we use a wireless TV sender to take the Sky Television signal from the Sky+ box downstairs to the television upstairs, and when the wireless antenna in the ADSL router is on, we get interference on the upstairs television.</p>

<p>Now, as I can hear <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/barryoconnor">@barryoconnor</a> saying, “why not just get Sky Multi-Room?” The reason is two fold. 1) We don’t watch enough TV upstairs to warrant another feed, and more importantly 2) I am cheap <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/wlEmoticon-smile1.png" alt="Smile" /></p>

<p>To start with, the solution to this problem was to simply kill the power to the wireless router. However, this was bad for a couple reasons. Firstly, it isn’t great for the device itself, just having the power pulled from it. And secondly, switching off the power stopped all inbound traffic, which given that I run a couple services from a server in my house, isn’t ideal. Also, the five minutes it takes to switch on another computer, to log into the router to switch it off is just too much like hard work!</p>

<p>NOTE: I tried every combination of wireless channel on both the router and the wireless sender, and none of them stopped the interference.</p>

<p>Jump forward a couple months, and a new solution presented itself in the form of a Windows Phone 7 application, which you can see a screen shot of above. This is a VERY simple application, and I certainly won’t be winning any prizes for design, but it serves it’s purpose. So, what does it do?</p>

<p>The router that I own, like many others, has a built in web server, that allows the administration of the device using a web interface. By logging into this web interface, and cracking open <a href="http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/">Fiddler</a>, I was able to figure out the necessary HTTP Post data in order to enable and disable the wireless antenna of the device. With this information, I was then able to create an <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.httpwebrequest.aspx">HttpWebRequest</a> in code with the required settings to actually enable/disable the wireless router from the button click on the Windows Phone 7. Below the buttons is a WebBrowser control which is used to simply show the response that is received from the request, as due to timeouts and other interwebs going ons, the first request doesn’t always work.</p>

<p>A recent refactoring of the project included creating a Web Service to do the actual work of talking to the Router, and all my Phone application has to do is call the Web Service methods.</p>

<p>An earlier Windows Mobile 6.5 version of this application went as far as to intercept incoming text messages with a known format from another phone to enable/disable the wireless antenna, but the Windows Phone 7 API does not expose the ability to intercept text messages (hopefully this will be available in later versions of the OS).</p>

<p>There are a couple extensions that I would like to add to this application, such as finding out the current state of the wireless router, i.e. enabled/disabled, but as yet, I haven’t had time to get round to it. One day…</p>

<p>For a slightly shorter explanation of how all this works, have a look <a href="http://www.tweetdeck.com/twitter/richardadalton/~PAHAI">here</a>.</p>

<p>If anyone out there wants some more information on this insanely over complicated set up, feel free to get in touch.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/vmware-workstation-troubles/" itemprop="url">VMWare Workstation Troubles…</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>At work, I use Windows 7 as the base operating system for my Desktop machine. It is a reasonably beefy machine, with an Intel i7 CPU and 8GB of RAM. The idea is that we can host multiple VM’s at the same time for development purposes.</p>

<p>In order to host the VM’s, I had both VMWare Workstation 6.5 installed, as well as Microsoft Virtual PC. Why the two virtualisation products I hear you ask? Well, let me tell you…</p>

<p>In order to connect to some clients network, we have to use a proprietary VPN Client, and unfortunately, this does not work on Windows 7, only Windows XP. Now, I could have just installed a copy of Windows XP using VMWare Wokstation (which is our default virtualisation product) however, that would have required a retail version of the OS, rather than the MSDN ones that we use for development purposes. As a result, I decided to enable the WIndows XP Mode on my Windows 7 host operating system, which I thought was a particularly sensible solution.</p>

<p>However, when I tried to run up Windows XP Mode at the same time as a VM hosted in VMWare Workstation, I was greeted with the following:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/VMWare-Workstation-troubles_11F5D/image.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/VMWare-Workstation-troubles_11F5D/image_thumb.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>Followed by this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/VMWare-Workstation-troubles_11F5D/image_3.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/VMWare-Workstation-troubles_11F5D/image_thumb_3.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>This actually crashed the VMWare Workstation hosted VM, and resulted in some corruption of one of me VM’s <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/VMWare-Workstation-troubles_11F5D/wlEmoticon-sadsmile.png" alt="Sad smile" /></p>

<p>Initially, I resigned myself to only having one virtualisation software running at once, as I couldn’t find an immediate solution to the problem.</p>

<p>However, talking to a colleague at work, who does the exact same thing as I was trying to do, said he was able to get it working no problem. Turns out, he was running VMware Workstation 7, not version 6.5.</p>

<p>A quick install, and I am happy to say that everything is now working perfectly</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/visual-studio-2010-crashes-when-i-open-build-details-page/" itemprop="url">Visual Studio 2010 Crashes When I Open Build Details Page</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>For that last few weeks I have noticed that every time I try to open a build details screen from my Team Foundation Server within Visual Studio 2010 I was greeted with this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image_thumb.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p><em>NOTE: By build details screen I mean the TFS build details screen which you can get to via Team Explorer | Builds | View Builds and then double click on an available completed build</em></p>

<p>The details of the event didn’t really provide much insight into what might be going on:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image1.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image_thumb1.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<pre><code>[![image](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image_thumb2.png)](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image2.png)  
</code></pre>

<p>But due to the fact that I am in the process of transitioning the code base from Visual Studio 2008 to Visual Studio 2010 there really wasn’t much of a push to get this working, as I could simply jump back to my 2008 VM and check what I needed.</p>

<p>The other day though I found myself with a couple minutes, so I thought that I would look into getting the problem fixed. A quick Bing turned up the following:</p>

<p><a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/Downloads/DownloadDetails.aspx?DownloadID=34824">http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/Downloads/DownloadDetails.aspx?DownloadID=34824</a></p>

<p>The description of the error:</p>

<blockquote>  
> 
> Visual Studio 2010 SP1 crashes or shows the following error when attempting to view a build report on a TFS 2008 server:
> 
>    
> 
> &#8220;TF50316: The following name is not valid. Verify that the name does not exceed the maximum character limit, only contains valid characters, and is not a reserved name&#8221;
> 
> </blockquote>


<p>Seemed to fit my problem exactly. I had installed Service Pack 1 for Visual Studio 2010 recently, and I don’t recall the build details screen working since then, and we are still using TFS 2008, so I thought I would give it a try, nothing to lose.</p>

<p>Thankfully, once this fix was installed, the build details page started working again.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Hot of the heels of <a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/ddd9/">DDD9</a> which I <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=28">attended in January</a>, this weekend was the turn of <a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/scotland2011/">DDD Scotland</a>.</p>

<p>Again, I had never attended this event before, and having seen what was on offer at DDD9 I was hopeful of more of the same, and I am happy to say that I was not disappointed. The <a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/scotland2011/Schedule.aspx">list of sessions</a> was immense and it actually made it quite difficult to choose which session of the five available that I wanted to attend.</p>

<p>On the day, this was made even worse by the additional of an alternative track which added another session to the mix. I decided to stick with my original selections, however some of the feedback from the alternative track sessions made me wish I had attended some of them (especially the “Agile is Dead”, and “How to Manage Your Manager” talks, but hindsight is a wonderful thing.</p>

<p>Personally, I think the sixth track worked out quite well, and hopefully this is something that the organisers can keep going with.</p>

<p>Speaking of the organisers, I have to congratulate Andy Gibson (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/argibson">@argibson</a>), Craig Murphy (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/camurphy">@camurphy</a>), Colin MacKay (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/colinmackay">@colinmackay</a>) and Barry Carr (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/barrycarr">@barrycarr</a>) (as well as all their helpers) for all their hard work! It really paid off, it was a great day, keep up the great work (and if you need any help, feel free to ask).</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/scotland2011/ViewSession.aspx?SessionID=676">Session 1</a> – Creating you Own Software Company: A Survival Guide</strong></p>

<p><strong>Presenter – Kendall Miller (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/kendallmiller">@kendallmiller</a>)</strong></p>

<p>Creating my own software company is certainly not something that I am thinking about, but this session was still very interesting. Kendall was very open about his experiences in setting up <a href="http://www.gibraltarsoftware.com/">Gibraltar Software</a>, and it gave some very interesting insights into the the thought processes behind setting up a business. For instance, pricing is not really something you have control over, but rather the price of your product is driven by the target audience. Kendall is a great speaker, and I would encourage anyone to attend his sessions.</p>

<p><em>Quote of the Session:</em></p>

<p><em>“That’s completely bollocks”</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/scotland2011/ViewSession.aspx?SessionID=707">Session 2</a> – Building seriously scalable websites with ASP.NET with and without Windows</strong></p>

<p><strong>Presenter – Chris Hay (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/chrishayuk">@chrishayuk</a>)</strong></p>

<p>By Chris’s own omission, this was the first time that he had given this talk, and given the amount of information that he was trying to condense into a single hour presentation, it was surprising to find that it ended up feeling a little “hectic” and “rushed”. In addition to this, the shell prompt that he was using on his Mac wasn’t really visible on the projector. However, and this is a big however, the session was still very good, and I have to give Chris a lot of credit for this. I learnt a lot from this session, including the use of <a href="http://haproxy.1wt.eu/">haproxy</a> to provide load balancing as well as the idea to split the dynamic and static content of your site onto different servers. The latter is something that I am very keen to try out. Chris mentioned that he is currently working on a book for Manning which delves deeper into the topics covered in this session, and I am looking forward to picking that book up when it comes out (although I still haven’t finished reading Azure in Action <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" />).</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/scotland2011/ViewSession.aspx?SessionID=669">Session 3</a> – Unit Testing, Test Driven Development and the Walking Skeleton</strong></p>

<p><strong>Presenter – Seb Rose (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/sebrose">@sebrose</a>)</strong></p>

<p>I have been hearing a lot about Unit Testing and TDD lately, both from fellow developers as well as online. TDD is not a philosophy that we have adapted at my work, but I was keen to learn more about it, and see how it could be applied. Seb gave a very enlightening talk, which I have to say that I enjoyed very much. (Although, he has pointed me at another couple books which I think I have to add to my growing collection, I have no idea when I am going to get round to reading them all). I especially like the myths that Seb dispelled during his talk, including “Why should I fix it? It’s not my code!”.</p>

<p><strong>Grok Talks</strong></p>

<p>Time was set aside at lunch time for some short Grok talks. However, due to the heat in the main room, I was only able to stay for a couple before heading outside to grab some air.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/scotland2011/ViewSession.aspx?SessionID=718">Session 4</a> – Real World SLUT (Silverlight Unit Testing)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Presenter – Daniel May (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/danielrmay">@danielrmay</a>)</strong></p>

<p>I was really looking forward to this talk as it had some direct relevance to the work that I am currently doing. Although I was able to take a few things from it, I sort of felt that the session morphed into a discussion of separation of concerns between your View and ViewModel, rather than on Unit Testing Silverlight applications. Obviously, this topic needs to be touched on in terms of setting up your application to the point that it can be unit tested, but based on the description of the session, I don’t think this was appropriate. In addition, given some extra time at the end of the session, there was an attempt at an impromptu demo to illustrate another concept. Although it was clear where the demo was going, it was clearly unrehearsed, and I don’t think it helped aid the description of the point.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/scotland2011/ViewSession.aspx?SessionID=688">Session 5</a> – Introduction to Kanban</strong></p>

<p><strong>Presenter – Chris McDermott (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/chrisvmcd">@chrisvmcd</a>)</strong></p>

<p>This was a very good session. Given a recent failed attempt at adopting SCRUM within a project, I was interested to see how a Kanban approach (where the philosophy of small incremental changes to a process is adopted) could work in a real life environment. Chris was able to draw on his experiences very well to put his point across. I specifically liked the retrospective that he did in terms of applying the Kanban approach to an old project that hadn’t used Kanban. It was nice to see where if Kanban had been used, the project could have been a lot better.</p>

<p><em>Quote of the Session:</em></p>

<p><em>“Stop starting and start finishing”</em></p>

<p><strong>Geek Dinner – China Buffet King</strong></p>

<p>After the fiasco of the Chinese meal for the Pre-Conference Dinner at DDD9 I think there was some concern that there might be a repeat here, but thankfully there wasn’t. Both the service and the food were amazing, to the point that no sooner had we finished a beer, another one would appear in front of us, amazing!!</p>

<p>After the meal it was back to the Ramada Jarvis hotel for a couple more drinks, and lots of interesting geek related chat! Following that a few braver soles decided that they would continue into the small hours of the morning, but I decided that enough was enough, and retired to bed. After seeing some of the <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/stack72/status/67136082424242176">tweets this morning</a>, I think I made the right decision <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" /></p>

<p><strong>Overall Thoughts of DDD Scotland</strong></p>

<p>Can’t say enough good things about it! I bring that many people into one place, and provide such a wide array of sessions and topics is just phenomenal. I don’t mind making long trips to places like Reading and Bristol for events like this, but given that this event is so close, there really is no excuse not to attend, and I would highly encourage all developers based in Scotland to come along.</p>

<p>Congratulations again to all the organisers, you did a great job, and you should be very proud!!!</p>

<p>The single criticism that I would have (and this is no fault of the organisers) is that the rooms did start to get very warm, uncomfortably so at times.</p>

<p>Remember, if you attended the conference, remember to check out the <a href="http://www.typemock.com/win">TypeMock website</a> for your chance to win some goodies!</p>

<p>I am looking forward to attending <a href="http://www.dddsouthwest.com/">DDD SW</a> (Bristol) next month, I just need to figure out how I am getting there and where I will be staying.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Through the <a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/">Aberdeen Developers website</a> I have been made aware of a job vacancy in the Aberdeen area.</p>

<p>The role will be as a software developer working on a brand new browser based product. In the short term, a prospective candidate would benefit from having some Delphi knowledge in order to work with some existing software. In addition, it would be beneficial if the candidate lived in the Aberdeen/Aberdeenshire area. The position would also ideally suit someone who has, or is, working on their own concept and wants to be a “start up”, and is looking for some cash injection, as this type of investment is available.</p>

<p>If you are interested in the position and would like some more information, then please feel free to contact Peter Gillian on pjg at skylark dot co dot uk, or you can call him on 01330 823950.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/software-development-packages/" itemprop="url">Software Development Packages</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I have been giving a lot of thought about the development software packages that I use on a daily basis (both at work and at home), and which ones, if any, I should change out. For example, I have been hearing a lot of good things about TeamCity (for the purposes of Continuous Integration) and CodeRush/ReSharper as IDE Productivity Tools.</p>

<p>As a result, I am looking to get some opinions from some fellow developers about what they are using.</p>

<p>What I currently use is the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Development Environment – Visual Studio 2010</p></li>
<li><p>Source Control – TFS</p></li>
<li><p>Continuous Integration – TFS</p></li>
<li><p>Work Item Management – TFS</p></li>
<li><p>Unit Testing – MSTest</p></li>
<li><p>Integration Testing – Nothing at the minute <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/517cd9ae4196_12CEC/wlEmoticon-sadsmile.png" alt="Sad smile" /></p></li>
<li><p>IDE Productivity Tools – StyleCop, Code Analysis</p></li>
<li><p>Various Visual Studio 2010 <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=3">Extensions</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>So basically, what I am hoping for is feedback on what you use, either at home or at work, and what you like about the packages that you use. Am I missing anything critical? Are there any software packages for development purposes that you are using, that you now simply couldn’t live without?</p>

<p>All opinions are welcome!</p>
