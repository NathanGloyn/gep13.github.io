<h2>It was a great event!</h2>

<p>Now that the dust has settled, and everyone has returned home after GiveCamp UK, I thought it was time to reflect on the weekend.  Was it good?  Was it bad?  What could be done better?</p>

<p>Bottom line, I thought it was an amazing event, and from a personal stand point, I got a lot out of the event, and I would happily take part in future events like this.</p>

<p>The first thing I have to say is a tremendous well done, and thank you, to all of the organisers of this event.  They really did an amazing job and they should be very proud of themselves.  Congratulations to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/stack72">Paul Stack</a>, and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/rachelhawley">Rachel Hawley</a>!!</p>

<p>What follows is how the weekend of GiveCamp UK broke down for me, and the members of <a href="http://theyoucanhub.org.uk/">TheYouCanHub</a> charity team.</p>

<h2>Friday, 21st October 2011</h2>

<p>My intention was to get into London reasonably early on Friday afternoon so that I could help Paul with anything that needed doing, and since I was travelling from Nottingham, I thought that this would be reasonably easy to achieve.  However, due to a problem with getting a taxi sorted out, I missed my train, and had to wait for the next one!</p>

<p>Anyway, after arriving in London and checking into my hotel, the next problem was finding the UCL venue.  Although located in a great place, I haven’t been to London very often, and finding my way around, is still a bit of a problem.  Help was at hand in the form of a tweet from <a href="http://www.twitter.com/davesussman">Dave Sussman</a> which directed me straight to the North Cloisters building of UCL.  Thanks Dave!</p>

<p>Not long after, Paul arrived with his car jam-packed full of crisps, juice and various other snacks, which was to be the staple diet of the eager programmers over the weekend.  With that unloaded, Paul asked if I could help him with another run to the cash and carry to pick up even more food!!</p>

<p>What happened next I hear you ask?  Well, we spend the next 3 hours travelling the 24 miles to the cash and carry!!  This was the first time that I had properly experienced London traffic, and it is not something that I am keen to do again!</p>

<p>As a result, we both missed the start of the GiveCamp UK introductions, but thankfully Rachel stepped up and got everyone organised, and we kept up with what was going on through the #GiveCampUK hash tag.  En route back, Paul gave me a quick overview of the Charities that were going to be attending the event, and what sort of projects they were looking to get completed.  On arrival back to UCL I set about starting to find a team that I could join.  People were already starting to naturally fall into groups and having not been there since the start, I did feel a little bit like an outsider, however, I then met up with Daniel Elliott (Team Lead) and Phil Jones, who were going to be working on <a href="http://theyoucanhub.org.uk/">TheYouCanHub</a> team, so I decided to join them.</p>

<p>With the team fully formed, we set about having a quick chat with Mel and Lou from <a href="http://theyoucanhub.org.uk/">TheYouCanHub</a>.  The were not able to make it in person, but we were able to chat to them on Skype.  They already had a very clear idea about what they wanted to achieve, and had detailed everything in a number of documents which they were able to send to us.  We essentially had a full set of requirements!</p>

<p>Their brief broke down quite simply…</p>

<p>Take their existing WordPress site, and make it better!  They had already identified a number of other websites which they liked, and we were able to take a lot of ideas from them, and make a decision about how we were going to proceed.</p>

<p>Now, some of you out there might be thinking “<em><strong>a WordPress site… Really? Where is the coding?</strong></em>” And I will be honest, for a while there, I was thinking the same.  However, at the end of the day, WordPress does what it does very well, and Mel and Lou wanted to use something that they were familiar with, so there was no point in trying to roll out a custom system so that we could actually cut some code.</p>

<p>The rest of the evening was used to plan out what we were going to do over the next day and a half, as well as searching through the extensive array of WordPress Plugins and Themes to see what we could make use of.</p>

<p>As I left UCL to head back from the hotel there were still a number of teams busy working hard, and I have to say that I did feel a little bit guilty leaving, however, we had done everything that was required for this evening, and we all thought that it would be best to get an early’ish night, ready for a full day tomorrow.</p>

<h2>Saturday, 22nd October 2011</h2>

<p>Woke up at 0700 and headed down to UCL.  By 0830 all the team members had arrived apart from one.  We were a man down!  Never mind though, we soldiered on, and we were committed to getting the job done.</p>

<p>The first real order of business was to get a WordPress site up and running so that we could begin testing and configuring the site in the way that was required.  This started out as everyone installing their own copy of WordPress on their laptops (which can be easily achieved using the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/web/downloads/platform.aspx">Microsoft Web Platform Installer</a>).  However, it quickly became apparent that this wasn’t going to work out.  Every time something was done on one machine, it would need to be done on another machine to test it.</p>

<p>We started to have a play with Heroku and AppHarbor (which Paul had organised to be used by the teams) but no one on the team had used these before, so rather than waste time trying to get it up and running, I set up a quick sub-domain on my own hosting provider, and got WordPress up and running.</p>

<p>With that in place we were able to work on one environment, and include everyone’s additions at the same time.  This did introduce it’s own problems, with a couple of people editing the same files at the same time, but once some processes had been put in place, this wasn’t an issue.</p>

<p>After a couple of hours, we “thought” we had something that quite closely resembled what the charity wanted, and really what was required next was confirmation of what they wanted, so that we could begin the “tidy-up” phase.</p>

<p>Mel and Lou from <a href="http://theyoucanhub.org.uk/">TheYouCanHub</a> arrived around lunch time, and we sat down and had a chat about what we had achieved.  Although they liked what we had done so far, it was clear that we had missed one crucial requirement, and it was time to go back to the drawing board.  I sat down and had a lengthy chat with Lou and was able to stub out exactly what they were trying to achieve.  With that in place, it was time to, literally, start again.</p>

<p>At this point, rather than continue with the WordPress site I had hosted on my hosting provider (<strong><em>SHAMELESS PLUG ALERT</em></strong>: They are called <a href="http://tracking.blacknight.com/aff_c?offer_id=5&amp;aff_id=37">Blacknight</a>, and offer a great service!) we checked to see whether we could start to use their “live” WordPress site.  We got an agreement to do this, so we set to work, with the first order of action to find a WordPress Plugin to do a complete back up of the entire site, including the database, in case things went wrong!</p>

<p>Due to the fact that I had got a grasp of the requirements from Lou, I was given the responsibility of issuing tasks to the Team members, which I “think” I did an alright job of.  This change in direction saw us retiring the WordPress theme that we had identified as being a close fit, and instead re-writing a new custom template from scratch.  Dibs have to go to the two Phil’s for bringing this all together!</p>

<p>We ended up working far later than we thought we were going to have to, as we actually thought we were going to be finished early, but never mind.  Again, it was back to the hotel for a few hours sleep before getting up early again.</p>

<h2>Sunday, 23rd October 2011</h2>

<p>Woke up at 0700 and headed down to UCL.  Again, the entire team was there quite early, and we set about putting the finishing touches to the site.  The site really started to come together once we had some images to put on it.  Mel did an amazing job of communicating all of this to us via email, and very quickly the site started to look complete.  “<em>Lorem ipsum</em>” placeholders started to be replaced by actual content, and we could see the site coming together in front of us.</p>

<p>Sooner than expected, 12:00 came round, and we had to down tools, and make sure that everything was finished up, and that everything was checked into Source Control.  For us, that meant taking a full backup of the web server directory and database backup and pushing this up to GitHub.  With that done, and laptops packed away, it was a case of tidying up and the North Cloisters area of UCL, and then heading outside to chill out in the sunshine and to enjoy some of the amazing hog roast that had been cooking outside since the small hours.  It was very yummy! All around there were smiling faces, and although everyone was very tired, it was clear to see that everyone had a great time!</p>

<p>At 1500 we moved to a lecture theatre where we got presentations from each of the teams regarding what they had created over the course of the weekend.  For our team, check out the following <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22E7oTzP1Os">video</a> which shows Daniel giving an interpretive dance!  I am very proud of the fact that we were actually able to demo the live site at the presentation.</p>

<p>It really was great to see what everyone had achieved, and several of the charities were represented at the presentations and it was amazing to see and hear their reactions to what they were going to be receiving.  It really did make it all worthwhile.</p>

<p>Following the presentations, there was a swag giveaway (with prizes totalling over £30,000).  Everyone who attended GiveCamp UK was given an 80GB SSD Hard Drive, which Paul had kept as an extra special surprise for the attendees.</p>

<p>After that, with the crowd starting to thin out, Paul and Lorraine gave me a lift to London Heathrow for my plane back up to Aberdeen.  Thanks again for the lift!</p>

<h2>What happens next?</h2>

<p>You may be wondering what happens to the Charities, now that they have received everything from the teams?  What happens when something goes wrong, or they need something else done to it?  I can’t speak for the rest of the teams, but we have agreed to make available a couple of hours a month of our own time to help out with anything that they need.</p>

<h2>The Team</h2>

<p>I wanted to say a personal thanks to all the members of <a href="http://theyoucanhub.org.uk/">TheYouCanHub</a> GiveCamp UK team.  It really was a pleasure meeting with you and working on this project.  You can see us pictured below courtesy of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bertcraven/">Bert Craven</a>.</p>

<h2>The Wildcard Project</h2>

<p>As mentioned in the blog post <a href="http://www.givecamp.org.uk/blog/introducing-our-givecamp-uk-2011-charity-projects">here</a> there was a special wildcard project created who were going to be starting the first phase of a completely open source CRM system that charities could use.  If you are interested in taking a look at what they achieved, you can see the code <a href="https://github.com/GiveCampUK">here</a>, the project is called GiveCRM.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>It is hard to believe, but <a href="http://www.givecamp.org.uk/">GiveCamp UK</a> is now only a four days away. If you haven’t seen it already, the list of Charities and Projects that are going to be involved can be found <a href="http://www.givecamp.org.uk/blog/introducing-our-givecamp-uk-2011-charity-projects">here</a>. I am really looking forward to finding out what Project I am going to be working on, and how I am going to be able to help out!!</p>

<p>With the day fast approaching, it is making me wonder whether I have everything that I need installed on my laptop. So I thought I would create a list of the applications that I think I am going to need, and currently have installed. Then, through the power of Twitter and RSS, I am hoping that other GiveCamp UK attendees can make suggestions to add to the list, that way I will have everything installed that is required.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>UPDATE 1: Added additional clients for VCS&rsquo;s, as well as kDiff, WinMerge (see <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=188">here</a> for Visual Studio setup) and Putty</p></li>
<li><p>UPDATE 2: Twitter Client added to the list</p></li>
<li><p>UPDATE 3: Added more VCS Clients to the list</p></li>
<li><p>UPDATE 4: Added some notes following feedback from attending GiveCamp UK, as well as pieces of hardware you might want to bring with you</p></li>

<p>Am I missing anything important that will be required for use at GiveCamp? I will update this blog post as I think about new things, and as suggestions are made.</p>

<p>Thanks to an email from Amazon, I have just found out that the new Stuart MacBride book is ready for pre-order, so I have just ordered it <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/wlEmoticon-smile2.png" alt="Smile" />.</p>

<p>The new book is called “<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0007344171/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0007344171">Birthdays for the Dead</a>”.</p>

<p>If you have never read any Stuart MacBride books, I would roughly recommend that you do.  I picked up his first book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0007193149/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0007193149">Cold Granite</a>, when I was going through Aberdeen Airport on a business trip, and since then, I have bought and read all his books.</p>

<p>The main series of books are based around Detective Logan McRae, who works for the Grampian Police in Aberdeen.  I have always liked the fact that I can read the book and know exactly where the characters are, and the local dialect used in the conversations is always good for a laugh!  There is definitely a serious tone to the books though, with crimes ranging from murder, to kidnap, to mob related executions, and drugs, so they are not for the faint hearted!</p>

<p>Like two of his other books, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0007349262/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0007349262">Halfhead</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1842999575/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=1842999575">Sawbones</a>, this new one takes a break from the Logan MacRae series, so I am really looking forward to reading it and seeing what it is like.  I will post a review once I have read it.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Like most geeks, I have both a desktop PC and a laptop (if I am being honest, I also have a NetBook as well). From time to time, I will be using these at the same time. Whether it is to do the monthly virus scans and updates, or whether it is transferring files between the two, etc.</p>

<p>Before finding “<a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/next/archive/2011/09/09/microsoft-garage-download-mouse-without-borders.aspx">Mouse without Borders</a>” it was a case of switching between the keyboard and mouse of my desktop, over to the keyboard and track pad of the laptop, but no more! Now I just use the same keyboard and mouse, and I get a flawless transition between each desktop.</p>

<p>Once setup, you can position tell “<a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/next/archive/2011/09/09/microsoft-garage-download-mouse-without-borders.aspx">Mouse without Borders</a>” how you want your machines configured, I have mine setup as follows:</p>

<p>and there are a host of options that you can configure:</p>

<p>There are other products on the market that do a similar job, for instance <a href="http://www.inputdirector.com/">InputDirector</a>, but I have never tried this software.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Back in February, I bought myself a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B002LVUWFE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B002LVUWFE">Kindle</a> and I blogged about it <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=93">here</a>. I have been very happy with it, and through some cracking deals at the likes of <a href="http://oreilly.com/">O’Reilly</a> and <a href="http://www.manning.com/">Manning Publications</a> I now have an extensive set of technical books on the Kindle. Now all I need is time to read them all <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/wlEmoticon-smile1.png" alt="Smile" />.</p>

<p>So, what is the problem?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0051QVF7A/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B0051QVF7A"><img src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.co.uk/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;Format=_SL110_&amp;ASIN=B0051QVF7A&amp;MarketPlace=GB&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822" alt="" /></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=www6thprimeco-21&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B0051QVF7A" alt="" /></p>

<p>Well, a colleague at work has just bought the new shiny <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0051QVF7A/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B0051QVF7A">Kindle</a>, pictured to the left, and I am jealous <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/wlEmoticon-sadsmile1.png" alt="Sad smile" />. It is a cracking piece of kit. In terms of screen real estate, it is exactly the same as the Kindle that I have, but the lack of the physical keyboard and smaller bevel around the outside, means that it is a much smaller device, and also lighter.</p>

<p>I thought that the lack of physical keyboard would bother me, but realistically, the only time that I use the keyboard is to enter the password to unlock the device, and that is it. Although a little bit of a pain to navigate an on-screen keyboard with the directional pad, it isn’t the end of the world.</p>

<p>So now the next question, do I flog my Kindle on eBay and get a new one? Or do I wait and see when the Kindle Touch will land in the UK? Do I even need touch screen for the Kindle? Questions, Questions Questions!</p>

<p>Anyone want an older model Kindle?</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/enough-is-enough-time-to-get-fit/" itemprop="url">Enough Is Enough! Time to Get Fit!</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Once upon a time, I used to actually be quite a fit and healthy guy. I did a lot of running, competed in a 10K, and went on a trek along the Great Wall of China. However, recently, all of that seems to have been forgotten and replaced with little or no exercise, and bad eating habits!</p>

<p>Well, all of that has got to change! I am now officially on a diet, and back at the gym.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000FMQ296/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B000FMQ296"><img src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.co.uk/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;Format=_SL110_&amp;ASIN=B000FMQ296&amp;MarketPlace=GB&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822" alt="" /></a></p>

<p><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=www6thprimeco-21&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B000FMQ296" alt="" /></p>

<p>This new endeavour wouldn’t be the same unless there was a least some amount of technology involved, so let me present to you the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000FMQ296/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B000FMQ296">Garmin Forerunner 305</a>. This little beauty, which is both a Heart Rate Monitor (via a chest strap) and GPS Recorder, is going to help me track how well/badly I am improving.</p>

<p>Quite simply this device “just works”. I have used it twice now, once to go for a hike up <a href="http://connect.garmin.com/activity/119878884#.TpBlRXjlwVE.twitter">Bennachie</a> and the other a simple walk around the <a href="http://connect.garmin.com/activity/120403009#.TpLNirc41VE.facebook">village</a>. And both times it has tracked me perfectly, with one exception when it claimed that my heart rate was 135% of my maximum heart rate, but I think that this was due to the chest strap not being tight enough.</p>

<p>Following these “tests” I will then be using the device to track the workouts that I do at the gym. Mostly this will be on the treadmill doing a Cardio Workout, but I will also be doing some interval training on the bike (not looking forward to that <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/wlEmoticon-sadsmile.png" alt="Sad smile" />).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000UO61HC/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B000UO61HC"><img src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.co.uk/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;Format=_SL110_&amp;ASIN=B000UO61HC&amp;MarketPlace=GB&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822" alt="" /></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=www6thprimeco-21&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=B000UO61HC" alt="" /></p>

<p>One thing that I think I will add is the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000UO61HC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B000UO61HC">Garmin Foot Pod</a> which I can use when I am running indoors, where the GPS is essentially useless.</p>

<p>All in all, I am looking forward to getting back to the same level of fitness that I once had, and as an incentive, I am looking into competing in the <a href="http://www.wildheartsinaction.org/santa_run">Aberdeen Santa Run</a>, I just need to convince some work colleagues/friends that this is a good idea <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" /></p>

<p>Before deciding on the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000FMQ296/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B000FMQ296">ForeRunner 305</a>, I looked at a number of other devices, including the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B003EGC47Y/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B003EGC47Y">ForeRunner 110</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0025UHKNS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B0025UHKNS">ForeRunner 405CX</a>, but I decided that although a little bit “clunkier”, the 305 offered more options in terms of display, so for me, it was the better choice.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Sadly, the Progressive .Net Tutorials 2011 have come to an end, but I am happy to report that I have had a great time. The quality and content of the sessions has been amazing, and the guys at Skills Matter do a great job in making sure that everything ticked over correctly.</p>

<p>A big congratulations has to go to everyone at Skills Matter! Thank you!</p>

<p>The thing that I really liked about the Progressive .Net Tutorials is the extended time of the sessions. Each session ran for almost 4 hours. This meant that you had plenty of time to digest the content of the presentation, and if required, to ask questions. In the case of the final session on the 3rd day, you were actually given time to try out the products that were being presented. This was great as it meant you got some time to “play” and if you had any questions, you could ask the experts in the room.</p>

<p>The other thing that I was amazed at was the speed at which Skills Matter were able to turn around the videos of the sessions. Before the end of the day, the video for the morning session was available to watch on their site. Truly amazing!! Now what I need to do is find some time to watch the videos for the sessions that I was not able to attend <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/35aceb50ed2b_AF56/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" />.</p>

<p>For a round up of each of the sessions that I attended you can take a look at the following links:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=361">Day 1 - Morning Session</a> - Ian Cooper and Sebastian Lambla.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=362">Day 1 - Afternoon Session</a> - Dylan Beattie.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=363">Day 2 - Morning Session</a> – Simon Brown</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=364">Day 2 - Afternoon Session</a> – Paul Stack</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=365">Day 3 - Morning Session</a> – Jon Skeet</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I had a lot of trouble deciding on the final session of the final day at the Progressive .Net Tutorials. The choice was between Nathan Gloyn (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/nathangloyn">@nathangloyn</a>) and his “<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/ajax-ria/you-think-you-know-agile">You think you know agile?</a>” and the “<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/ajax-ria/introduction-to-nancy-and-simple-data">Introduction to Nancy and Simple.Data</a>” talk featuring Mark Rendle (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/markrendle">@markrendle</a>) and Steven Robbins (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/grumpydev">@grumpydev</a>).</p>

<p>Why the debate? Well, let me tell you…</p>

<p>We have recently tried and failed to implement an Agile approach in a project, so I am fairly sure that we will not be using an Agile approach for the foreseeable future. Coupled with the fact that I have seen an earlier Kanban talk from Nathan, initially I was leaning towards Mark and Steven’s session. In addition, in a recent blog <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=313">post</a> I talked about how is was striving to becoming a better developer and in order to do this I feel I need to learn more languages and frameworks, and the Nancy and Simple.Data talk seemed to fit that bill perfectly.</p>

<p>In the end, I opted to attend the Nancy and Simple.Data talk (sorry Nathan <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/beed2e344009_119E0/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" />)</p>

<p>This session was split straight down the middle. The first half was devoted to an introduction to both Nancy and Simple.Data, and the second half was handed over to the delegates to create a sample “To Do” application. This format worked really well. It gave me the opportunity to directly apply what we had been told about, with the benefit of having Mark and Steven in the room, if there were any questions.</p>

<p>What struck me immediately about both packages is how quickly you can get up and running with both of them. There are NuGet packages available for both and each one are split into a number of smaller packages so that you can only take what you need.</p>

<p>For instance:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>install-package Nancy.Hosting.Self</p></li>
<li><p>install-package Nancy.Hosting.AspNet</p></li>
<li><p>install-package Nancy.Hosting.Wcf</p></li>
<li><p>install-package Nancy.Hosting.Owin</p></li>
<li><p>install-package Nancy.Viewengines.Razor</p></li>
<li><p>install-package Nancy.Authentication.Forms</p></li>
</ul>


<p>And:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>install-package Simple.Data.SqlServer</p></li>
<li><p>install-package Simple.Data.SqlCompact40</p></li>
<li><p>install-package Simple.Data.Core</p></li>
<li><p>install-package Simple.Data.Mysql</p></li>
</ul>


<p>This is a prime example of the packaging that was described in the <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=361">first session on Monday</a>.</p>

<p>Once the core packages were installed:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>install-package Nancy.Hosting.AspNet</p></li>
<li><p>install-package Simple.Data.SqlServer</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Getting a basic website up and running is as simple as:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; Hello : NancyModule
    {
        &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; Hello()
        {
            Get[&lt;span class="str"&gt;"/"&lt;/span&gt;] = _ =&gt; &lt;span class="str"&gt;"Hello World!"&lt;/span&gt;;
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>And:</p>

<pre><code>        &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; Main(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;[] args)
        {
            var db = Database.OpenNamedConnection(&lt;span class="str"&gt;"prognet”&lt;/span&gt;);
            var hello = db.Hello.FindById(1);
            Console.WriteLine(&lt;span class="str"&gt;"{0} {1}!"&lt;/span&gt;, hello.Greeting, hello.Subject);
        }
</code></pre>

<p>Simples!</p>

<p>With this fully discussed, Mark then showed a more fully functional sample in the form of his “Heckle” application which you can find linked below.</p>

<p>Speaking to Mark after the session the one problem that I had was, I couldn’t see past how you actually use Nancy and Simple.Data in a “proper” application. By that I mean an application that fully separates the layers/tiers, UI, BLL and DAL, etc. Mark pointed me at <a href="https://github.com/ToJans/NerdBeers">NerdBeers</a> which I am going to have to take a look at, as I think it will go along way to cement my understanding.</p>

<p>All in all, a great session that seemed to be enjoyed by all!</p>
