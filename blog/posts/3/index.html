		<h1>Increasing my Synology DS1512+ RAM to 3GB</h1>

<p>I have to say, I love my <a href="http://www.synology.com/products/product.php?product_name=DS1512%2B">Synology DS1512+</a>!  Out of the box, it comes with 1GB of RAM, which, if you are solely doing file sharing, is more than enough.  However, over the last couple months, I have started doing more and more with my Synology Server:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Hosting Web Sites</p></li>
<li><p>Running a Plex Media Server</p></li>
<li><p>Backing up to the Cloud using CrashPlan</p></li>
</ul>


<p>As a result, I have noticed that certain things are taking longer than they &ldquo;should&rdquo;.  I decided that I wanted to increase the amount of RAM that is in the device.  Digging around the <a href="http://forum.synology.com/enu/">Synology Forums</a> it was clear that this is possible (with some people reporting that they were able to get 4GB to be recognised), it is just a case of deciding what RAM to go for.</p>

<p>I opted to go for <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0050X1OQ6/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">this from Amazon</a>, and I am happy to report that it all worked perfectly!  After installing, the RAM was immediately detected, and the Synology Server is running very smoothly.  Definitely recommend the upgrade to anyone who has not yet done it.  Very cheap to do, with a marked improvement in performance.</p>

		<h1>My Chocolatey Talk at Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group</h1>

<p>On Thursday 28th March 2013, I presented a talk at the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group entitled &ldquo;Mmmm, Chocolatey Goodness!&rdquo;.  If you attended the session, and are interested in seeing the demonstrations that were used in the presentation, or the slide desk, you can find this information below.  If you did attend, let me say thank you very much, and I very much hope you enjoyed it!</p>

<h1>The Code</h1>

<p>As explained on the night, there was very little &ldquo;code&rdquo; used within this presentation, but rather it was a demonstration of how Chocolatey can used to install, update, and uninstall packages on your computer.  If you are interested in the demonstrations that were shown on the night, you can check them out <a href="https://github.com/gep13/ChocolateyDemos/wiki">here</a>.</p>

<h1>The Slides</h1>

<p>A full copy of the slides that were used on the day can be found attached to this post, and you can see a preview of them below:</p>

		<h1>DevOpsDays has now finished, but had a great time&hellip;</h1>

<p>In a change to the normal Developer Conferences that I attend, I have just finished up at the <a href="http://devopsdays.org/">DevOpsDays </a>London Conference.  More and more I have hearing about how you can better improve the deployment of applications and software by closely combining both the Developer and Operations teams.  This is a relatively new idea to me, and I was very interested to hear, from people who have done this, what can be achieved!</p>

<p>This was a very &ldquo;different&rdquo; conference to what I have attended in the past, but in this case, &ldquo;different&rdquo; is a good thing!  The format was similar, in the sense that there were prepared session on each morning from various speakers, but each afternoon was given over to Open Spaces (more on this below).  I had never been to an Open Space session before, and I was very intrigued.  Turns out they are a GREAT way to learn!  In addition, just before lunch time, there were a series of Ingite talks (again, more on these below).</p>

<p>Overall, I got a lot from this conference.  After two days of hearing what can be done in terms of Configuration Management, Automated Deployments, Team Collaboration, my mind is buzzing with how some of these principles can be taken back to the office.  As to how many we will be able to implement, that is another question, but the fact that I now know that some of them exist, is half the battle!</p>

<p>What follows are some rough notes taken across the duration of the two days.</p>

<h1>Prepared Sessions</h1>

<p>In total, across the two days, there were seven prepared sessions.  Details on these can be seen below:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Niek Bartholomeus</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>&ldquo;DevOps for Dinosaurs&rdquo;</em></p></li>
<li><p>This was a really great introduction to what DevOps is, and what it is trying to achieve.  The talk centered around the work that Niek had done in a company that he worked at to bring DevOps processed into being.  It was really great to hear the experiences from someone who had been through the process.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/niekbartho/devops-for-dinosaurs">Slides</a></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>John Clapham</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>&ldquo;Checking DevOps Vital Signs&rdquo;</em></p></li>
<li><p>In this talk, John explained how in applying DevOps to his organisation, they attempted to garner some metrics so that they could accurately &ldquo;measure&rdquo; how it was helping.  This is a big stumbling block for DevOps.  i.e. how do you prove that the system is working, and actually providing value.  They chose to do this by measuring several vital signs (Cycle Time, Shared Purpose, Motivation, Collaboration, Effectiveness).  The first is reasonably simple to measure, but the others not so much.  They opted to collect this information in the form of a questionnaire.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>David Mytton</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>&ldquo;StartOps: Growing an Ops Team from 1 founder&rdquo;</em></p></li>
<li><p>Again, another interesting session, where David explained the decisions that he had taken in establishing his business.  He was in a position where he had to be pragmatic in adopting the tools and processes that he did.  As the company grew, he was able to adopt different tools and services, to ensure that the company was heading in the right direction.</p></li>
<li><p>Slides will appear <a href="http://blog.serverdensity.com/">here</a></p></li>
<li><p>Some interesting posts <a href="http://www.serverdensity.com/devopsdays/">here</a></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Deri Jones</p>

<ul>
<li><em>&ldquo;Adding Business Metrics&rdquo;</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Thomas Falkenberg and Nils Probson</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>&ldquo;DevOps and the traditional Enterprise IT&rdquo;</em></p></li>
<li><p>A very open, and honest, discussion of how the team at Payback had slowly, over the period of two years, implemented a culture of DevOps.  They found that they are now in a position where Dev and Ops teams have common goals.  However, this can only be achieved by:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Working together</p></li>
<li><p>One step at a time</p></li>
<li><p>Change takes time and patience</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>An important takeaway from this talk &ldquo;The term DevOps helped form a common language, a mantra.  i.e. if the business has a problem, then the company, both the Dev and Ops, need to work together to fix the issue</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Sam Eaton</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>&ldquo;DevOps and the hell of a Thousand Different Platforms&rdquo;</em></p></li>
<li><p>This was an amazing talk!  Sam is clearly enthusiastic about this topic, and this flowed through in his talk.  I later found out that this was his first public talk, which certainly didn&rsquo;t show!  He had some very interesting ideas, the best of which was the &ldquo;FailCake&rdquo;.  Basically, in collaborating between Dev and Ops, it is &ldquo;ok&rdquo; to make mistakes, but these have to be discussed immediately within the team, without associating blame.  They best way they have found to do this is by bringing cake to the meetings!</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Gene Kim</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&ldquo;How can we better sell DevOps&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>This was a VERY inspiring session.  Gene Kim, an author of the hugely popular &ldquo;The Phoenix Project&rdquo; book, explained how to best sell DevOps within the enterprise.  I would highly encourage you to take a look at the slides linked below as they explain, in detail, the barriers that exist Dev and Ops team, and how they are perceived from either side.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/realgenekim/how-can-we-better-sell-devops/">Slides</a></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h1>Open Spaces</h1>

<p>For me, this was the stand out part of the conference.  I had never been to an Open Space before this conference, but I will definitely be looking to attend others.  I am also going to suggest that this is something that we should be looking to include within DDD events.</p>

<p>The format is reasonably simple.  Anyone can suggest a topic to be discussed in an Open Space.  This can be asking for an answer to a question.  Providing a demonstration of a piece of software, or technology.  Pretty much anything.</p>

<p>With the sessions proposed, these are then organised &ldquo;roughly&rdquo; into order, and people &ldquo;vote&rdquo; with their feet, and go to the sessions that interest them.  This then takes the form of an open discussion, where anyone is free to talk, ask questions, and provide input.</p>

<p>We were told that Open Spaces follow three main principles:</p>

<pre><code>* Whenever it starts is the right time


* Whatever happens is the only thing that could have


* It's over when it's over
</code></pre>

<p>All I can say is&hellip;</p>

<p>Amazing!  I got so much out of these sessions.  So many snippets of information, and suggestions.</p>

<h1>Ignites</h1>

<p>Before attending DevOpsDays, I hadn&rsquo;t heard of Ignites.  Turns out this form of talks (which were held on both days just before lunch time) are similar to the 20 x 20 talks that I have seen at DDD events.  Basically, there are a set number of slides, each of which are timed to automatically transition to the next slide.  The speaker has to keep up with each transition, as they can&rsquo;t go back to a previous slide.  Topics here ranged from a custom-built tool for automatic deployments to being conscious of the server farms that you are using and their carbon footprint.</p>

<p>Well done to everyone who was brave enough to do one of these Ignites, I still think the format is very difficult, and I wouldn&rsquo;t like to do one myself.</p>

<p>Some of the slides that I am aware of from these Ignites can be found here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jedi4ever/what-ifconfigmgtwasdesignedbygamers">What If Config Management - Patrick Debois</a></li>
</ul>


<h1>Recommendations</h1>

<p>During the various sessions, and Open Spaces, there were a number of recommendations made.  These included blogs, podcasts, books, etc.  I have captured the ones that I could below.  If I have missed anything, or if there are any that you would like to add, please feel free to get in touch.</p>

		<h1>Today was the last day of DevWeek</h1>

<p>Well, it has been a long, but enjoyable, week at DevWeek, and today was the last day.  Today was another full day workshop, and I decided to attend the Continuous Delivery Workshop with Neal Ford.</p>

<p>People who have been following this series of posts will know that I have been rather lucky, winning both a Surface RT and a Telerik DevCraft Complete License.  There were no prizes won today, but you will all be happy to know that I have purchased a Euro Millions lottery ticket.  I will keep you posted on whether I win anything :-)</p>

</ul>


<h1>Post-Conference Workshop at DevWeek</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Neal Ford (you can find his blog <a href="http://nealford.com/">here</a>, and his twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/neal4d">here</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Topic: </strong>Continuous Delivery Workshop</p>

<blockquote>Getting software released to users is often a painful, risky, and time-consuming process. This workshop sets out the principles and technical practices that enable rapid, incremental delivery of high quality, valuable new functionality to users.
Through automation of the build, deployment, and testing process, and improved collaboration between developers, testers and operations, delivery teams can get changes released in a matter of hours – sometimes even minutes – no matter what the size of a project or the complexity of its code base.
The workshop materials are derived from the best-selling book ‘Continuous Delivery’, and were created in collaboration with the authors and other of my ThoughtWorks colleagues.</blockquote>


<h1>Thoughts</h1>

<p>Overall, I have to say that this was a very well structured and executed presentation.  Neal obviously understands this area very well, and was able to field a number of questions from the audience.  There was loads of active conversation from the audience, which made it even more interesting.  Lots of conversation regarding real-life situations, and experiences.</p>

<p>The one thing that I thought was missing from the Workshop was some demos.  There was lots of description of the deployment pipeline, and using puppet to automate the configuration of a server, but I think what really would have cemented these ideas was an example.  Even if this was a simple website application being packaged, and deployed onto even a single server, at the click of a button.  This would have made for a very cool end demonstration to summarize the whole discussion.</p>

<h1>Takeaways</h1>

<p>There really was loads to think about in this talk.  Some of the stand out questions, takeaways were as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How often do you release to users?</p>

<ul>
<li>Correct answer of course is that you should be ready to release to users whenever they require it.  Software should always be in a deployable state.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>How long would it take your organisation to deploy a change that involves just one line of code?</p></li>
<li><p>Thinking about the above, can you do this in a repeatable fashion, that doesn&rsquo;t involve crazy amounts of over time?</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure there is a clear delineation between Unit Tests and Functional Tests, and run these as separate parts of your delivery pipeline</p></li>
<li><p>Features Toggles gives you an alternative to creating many Feature Branches, avoiding the problem of merging</p></li>
<li><p>Going Live should be just another deployment that you are already practiced at internally</p></li>
<li><p>You should strive of Continuous Integration of your Databases as well as code</p></li>
<li><p>Look to make use of Puppet and Chef to configure development and staging environments, and store the configuration within your source control</p></li>
<li><p>When implementing Continuous Delivery, first gather metrics of current state of deployment, i.e. lead times and cycle times, and then compare after implementing Continuous Delivery</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>Quotes</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>&ldquo;Melt down silly architectural barriers between different areas of the organisation&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;If it hurts&hellip; Do it more often!&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;Bring the pain forward&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;Rational ClearCase i the most hostile pice of software towards Agile Development&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;Git is one of my favourite tools&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;Avoid life in the knitted Castle&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;The biggest PITA around software updates is data migration and schema changes&rdquo;</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>Overall Thoughts</h1>

<p>As I have said in my other posts, I have had a really good time at DevWeek, and I am happy to say that I have learnt a lot this week.  Hoping to be able to take back a lot of what I have learnt and start applying them at work.</p>

<p>Huge congratulations to the organisers of DevWeek, they did a great job, and a huge thanks to all the staff of the Barbican and the helpers at DevWeek!</p>

<p>I am very happy to say that today started where yesterday finished off.  I won a Telerik DevCraft Complete license.  Big thanks to Telerik for this! As a number of people on twitter have suggested, I will be purchasing a lottery ticket for this weekend!  Who knows, I might be a winner!</p>

<h1>First Morning Session</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Brock Allen (you can find his blog <a href="http://brockallen.com/">here</a>, and twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/brocklallen">here</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Topic: </strong>Internals of security in ASP.NET</p>

<blockquote>Security is crucial for online applications. This session on security discusses the basics and then the internals of authentication and authorization in ASP.NET. We will discuss Windows and Forums authentication, how roles are assigned to the user and how to control authorization in both WebForms and MVC applications.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>As per Brock&rsquo;s talk yesterday, this was another very well executed presentation, detailing the fine details of how Security works in ASP.NET (both Windows and Forms Authentication).  This talk got down to the nitty-gritty of how things work, with lots of great insights that showed how depth of knowledge on the subject.  You could argue that some of the topics were &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that everyone does them.  It is only when they are laid out in detail as they were in this talk, that you start to think about what you need to do in your own applications.</p>

<p><strong>Takeaways</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>You can add certificates into Fiddler (which allows you to do &ldquo;man in the middle&rdquo; attacks on yourself</p></li>
<li><p>Encryption should not be used to store passwords, you should hash the password</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://brockallen.com/2012/09/02/think-twice-about-using-membershipprovider-and-simplemembership/">Think twice about using MembershipProvider (and SimpleMembership)</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/brockallen/BrockAllen.MembershipReboot">MembershipReboot</a> - open source alternative to the above</p></li>
<li><p>FormsAuthenticationModule - intercepts all requests, and does the authentication from the cookie that is sent with the request</p></li>
<li><p>If you are doing ajax calls, you can use the HttpContext.Response.SuppressFormsAuthenticationRedirect to prevent the default redirect that would happen (which is of little use in ajax call)</p></li>
<li><p>The Authorize Attribute can be used to secure on both Roles and Users</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Quotes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>&ldquo;If you are not doing SSL, you are not taking this serious!&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been gabbing and gabbing about authentication, what about authorization?&rdquo;</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>Rest of the day</h1>

<p>The final session of today was one on NoSQL (specifically MongoDB) and I was very interested in seeing this!  On reading the schedule for the other sessions, it was clear that Michael was doing three back to back sessions, that each built on top of each other, to complete a full application.  Essentially, another full day workshop.  As a result, I decided to attend all three of them.</p>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Michael Kennedy (you can find his blog <a href="http://blog.michaelckennedy.net/">here</a>, and twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/mkennedy">here</a>)</p>

<p><strong>First Topic: </strong>Nine ways your next ASP.NET MVC project can be better</p>

<blockquote>So you’re ready to start that new and ambitious ASP.NET MVC project. Maybe you’re kicking off a new startup or just finally moving that old-and-crusty Web Forms project into the modern development world. Either way, this talk will give you some easy things you can do immediately after creating that new MVC project that you will thank yourself for as your project grows in complexity.
This talk will be based on my related blog post here: [http://bit.ly/QoCxnC](http://bit.ly/QoCxnC)
We’ll examine each piece of advice using live demos with Visual Studio and some external tools such as YSLOW. We’ll also look at how to “modernize” MVC 3 projects with best practices built into MVC 4 projects (CSS bundles, etc.).</blockquote>


<p><strong>Second Topic:</strong> Building rich input forms in ASP.NET MVC</p>

<blockquote>ASP.NET MVC has gained broad adoption over the last year. This is in part due to its clean and simple design. However, one aspect that newcomers typically get hung up on is building pages that accept user input in various manners. In this talk we will explore the powerful features of ASP.NET MVC that allow us to build rich forms that accept user input. We’ll begin by discussing the built-in HTML Helpers and Model Binding. Next we’ll add validation and show how we can do both client and server-side validation using DataAnnotations. We’ll see that sometimes using domain models as our form-bound objects doesn’t make sense and so we will cover more advanced scenarios using View Models. Finally, time permitting, we’ll see how client-side programming with JavaScript and jQuery can take this even further.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Third Topic:</strong> Applied NoSQL in .NET</p>

<blockquote>Perhaps you’ve heard about the next generation of databases roughly classified as NoSQL databases? These databases are generally much better than RDBMS at scaling, performance, and ease-of-development (e.g. in NoSQL the object-relational impedance mismatch usually disappears). Unfortunately, many talks on NoSQL are very academic and general. Not this one.
This session will introduce the ideas around the so-called NoSQL movement, and we’ll learn how to leverage MongoDB (a popular open source NoSQL db) to build .NET applications using LINQ as the data access language. We’ll build out a .NET application using LINQ and MongoDB in a series of interactive demos using Visual Studio 2012 and C#.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>Overall, this was a really good series of presentations.  Each one built on the last, and the end result was a complete sample application that shows how to create an ASP.NET MVC Application, using MongoDB as the back-end.  I have been told be Michael that both the sample code for the talks and the slides will be made available, so I will be keeping an eye out for those!</p>

<p>The final session, although the most interesting for me, was (in my opinion) a little rushed in terms of the code that was shown, and there were a couple of problems during the demos that meant there was a bit of jumping around in the code.  However, this was more than made up for in the question and answer session at the end of the talk, lots of great info here, especially the discussion between whether to use MongoDB or RavenDB.</p>

<p>Also, during the second session, there was quite a lot of banging noises coming from elsewhere in the Barbican Centre, which was a little off-putting.</p>

<p><strong>Takeaways</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Lots of great tips about how to improve the default ASP.NET MVC project.  Far too many to list here, but check out Michael&rsquo;s blog post linked above.</p></li>
<li><p>Suggestion to use <a href="http://usablica.github.com/front-end-frameworks/compare.html">front-end frameworks</a> for CSS</p></li>
<li><p>Make use of a <a href="http://www.cssreset.com">reset.css</a></p></li>
<li><p>Make use of the Get, Post, Redirect pattern</p></li>
<li><p>For server-side validation, use ModelState.IsValid</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.toptensoftware.com/markdowndeep/">MarkDownDeep</a> - very cool</p></li>
<li><p>MongoDB runs as a Windows Service</p></li>
<li><p>There are numerous Management Tools including:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>MongoVue</p></li>
<li><p>LinqPad</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Any changes to the &ldquo;schema&rdquo; of the objects, will require running a script on the existing database</p></li>
<li><p>In production, you should have at least two instances of MongoDB</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>Overall Thoughts</h1>

<p>Another busy, but highly enjoyable day at DevWeek.  Was also able to squeeze in a kick lunch meeting with Paul, Hadi, Matt, and Howard.  Was great to catch up with people I haven&rsquo;t seen in a while, as well as put faces to twitter names!</p>

<p>So today was a great day!  Not only were there some top class presentations on Async ASP.NET, JavaScript, Web API and SignalR, but I was also lucky enough to win a Surface RT!  This was thanks to <a href="http://www.k2.com/platform/workflow">K2</a> who were running a prize giveaway.  Huge thanks go to them, and although they didn&rsquo;t have the Surface to give me on the day, I am reassured that this will be delivered to me as soon as they have it available :-)</p>

<h1>First Morning Session</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Brock Allen (you can find his blog <a href="http://brockallen.com/">here</a>, and twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/brocklallen">here</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Topic: </strong>Async ASP.NET</p>

<blockquote>Asynchronous programming is all the rage these days and was a major theme in the most recent release of .NET. In this session we’ll look at what async means for web applications for both client and server code. We’ll see how ASP.NET has had async support for over 10 years and how WebForms and MVC provide an easy to use async programming model. We’ll then look at async client programming using JavaScript and jQuery, HTML5 WebWorkers and finally we’ll conclude with the ever popular SignalR library for supporting async communication.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>I really enjoyed this presentation.  It was almost a near perfect <em>continuation</em> (see what I did there?) to Andrew Clymer&rsquo;s talk that I went to yesterday.  This talk went into specifics about how things used to be done in ASP.NET and how you can start to make use of both Task, and async/await in ASP.NET.  There were loads of samples shown, and his slides were very detailed, which meant that it was really easy to follow along.  Great presentation!</p>

<p><strong>Takeaways</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>ASP.NET has had async support since .Net 1.1</p></li>
<li><p>HttpTaskAsyncHandler base class is new in .Net 4.5</p></li>
<li><p>HttpContext is NOT thread safe, i.e contexts don&rsquo;t flow by default, so when doing continuations manually, you have to take care of ensuring the original context is passed into the callback.</p></li>
<li><p>jQuery doesn&rsquo;t work in WebWorkers, since it is dependent on the DOM.  There is however a stripped down version of jQuery available which you can use in WebWorkers</p></li>
<li><p>jQuery supports a &ldquo;promise&rdquo; i.e. the .then() syntax</p></li>
<li><p>Brock indicated that the source code for his presentation will be available on his blog in due course.</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>Second Morning Session</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Hadi Hariri (you can find his blog <a href="https://twitter.com/hhariri">here</a>, and twitter <a href="http://hadihariri.com/">here</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Topic: </strong>Just because it&rsquo;s JavaScript doesn&rsquo;t give you the right to write rubbish</p>

<blockquote>JavaScript, the language that we all laughed at and our usage of it was limited to copy/paste of scripts to have some dynamic content in a web page, has all grown up. From jQuery on the client-side to Node.js on the server, everywhere you look there’s JavaScript. Unfortunately there’s also a ton of horrible, twisted and somewhat convoluted code that would make any developer that remotely cares about clean code suicidal.
A dynamic language that has somewhat given us a licence to do anything we want has been abused to the point that much of the blame has been placed on the language itself as opposed to the developers.
In this talk we’ll discuss some of the patterns and anti-patterns of JavaScript, things you should and shouldn’t do.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>This was by far, the BEST presentation that I saw today!</p>

<p>Ok, so Hadi asked me to say that, but seriously, I felt that it was a very good talk.  Hadi raised a very interesting question in &ldquo;how&rdquo; JavaScript is being developed.  In many ways, it is still seen as the &ldquo;baby brother&rdquo;, the &ldquo;scripting language&rdquo;, the &ldquo;User Interface Language&rdquo;, and as a result, it doesn&rsquo;t get treated with the same respect.  When you are doing other development, there are things like Unit Testing, Code Coverage, Continuous Delivery, etc.  Now, he wasn&rsquo;t saying that there aren&rsquo;t the equivalent systems for JavaScript, but rather, that they are not used with the same vigour.  If we, as developers, are going to start utilising JavaScript to the extent that we are likely to, we have to start giving it the respect it deserves.  This means actually &ldquo;learning&rdquo; it, rather than just copy and pasting from online sources.  A very well thought out and well executed presentation!</p>

<p><strong>Takeaways</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Common issue with writing code - as you write more, it becomes harder to maintain.  Writing with JavaScript takes you quickly down this route.</p></li>
<li><p>Historically, there hasn&rsquo;t been much tooling for JavaScript.  This has now changed, and it needs to start being used.</p></li>
<li><p>JSLint.com - online validation for JavaScript</p></li>
<li><p>Always use ===</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Quotes</strong></p>

<p>Due to Hadi&rsquo;s style of presentation, there are quite a few quotes here, many of which I believe were said in jest, so please don&rsquo;t take them out of context:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&ldquo;Feel free to get up and leave&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;The aim of this talk is to show you how utterly crap JavaScript&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;As though JavaScript of the client isn&rsquo;t bad enough, now we have it on the server!&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;JavaScript is a &lsquo;write-once&rsquo; language&rdquo; - i.e. you never want to look at the code again</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;Hopefully I will convert you, and you will all hate JavaScript&rdquo;</p></li>

<h1>First Afternoon Session</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Dominick Baier (you can find his blog <a href="http://leastprivilege.com/">here</a>, and twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/leastprivilege">here</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Topic: </strong>Patterns and techniques for securing REST/HTTP-based services and (ASP.NET) Web APIs</p>

<blockquote>The industry is moving to an HTTP/Web API based approach when it comes to modelling web services. These services are typically much more lightweight compared to their SOAP counterparts, which makes them easier to use in cross-platform and device architectures. But are they maybe too lightweight? Can they fulfil the security requirements? It turns out they can! In this talk we will have a look at how authentication and authorization can be implemented in HTTP-based services in general, and we’ll have a look at the security features of Microsoft’s new framework called ASP.NET Web API in particular. In addition we’ll shed light on what terms like OAuth2, JWT, OpenID and WS-Federation actually mean, and where these technologies make sense.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>With all the buzz around Web API, it was interesting to hear in this session what needs to be done &ldquo;behind the scenes&rdquo; to ensure that things are secure.  There are several gotchas, such as lack of built-in support for cross domain applications in Web API.  The infrastructure is there to do it yourself, but it is a lot of work, and you have to know what you are doing.  Thankfullly, Dominick, and his mates at <a href="http://thinktecture.com/">thinktecture</a> have created the IdentityModel and IdentityServer (which can be found <a href="https://github.com/thinktecture">here</a>) which attempts to fill this void.  These projects are open source, and released under an MIT license, meaning that you can do whatever you want with them.  A very good presentation, although, I did feel that in parts, it was a little rushed.  Also, no fault of Dominick&rsquo;s, but the room was a little warm, which I think was a contributing factor to the guy in front of me sleeping through out the entire talk.  I think several people were put off by this, as the gentleman in question was snoring quite loudly, but no-one had the heart to wake him.</p>

<p><strong>Takeaways</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>All Web API Security is built on top of SSL</p></li>
<li><p>Authorize Attribute on ApiController specifies what Authentication is required</p></li>
<li><p>New AllowAnonymous Attribute to specify that no Authentication is required</p></li>
<li><p>You can create your own Authorization Filter</p></li>
<li><p>No built-in support for Cross Domain applications</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://openidtest.uninett.no/jwt">Useful site</a> for decoding tokens</p></li>
<li><p>Token-based Authentication is &ldquo;THE&rdquo; way to do it</p></li>
<li><p>When generating tokens, keep the token lifetime short</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Quotes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>&ldquo;IF you are ignoring SSL Certificate Errors, you are not doing security properly&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;For some reason it is in German&hellip; That means it is extra secure!&rdquo; - when talking about a login prompt that appeared in German text</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>Second Afternoon Session</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Christian Weyer (you can find his blog <a href="http://weblogs.thinktecture.com/cweyer/">here</a>, and twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/christianweyer">here</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Topic: </strong>I wanna be cool! Push communication with SignalR for the web &amp; beyond</p>

<blockquote>Google, Facebook & Co. are leading the way: users want to see data and updates, live & now. There is need for a server or service to send messages and data into clients – without the client actually explicitly asking. Christian Weyer shows how .NET developers can implement this with SignalR – a framework with a simple yet powerful programming model. You should not have to care about the underlying protocols and (quasi-) standards in order to realize bi-directional communication over standard network infrastructure with potentially any device (desktop, browser, mobile) – not just for the web.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>For me, Christian&rsquo;s session at last years DevWeek was a stand out one!  He is an amazing presenter, and clearly loves what he does.  This session was no exception!  We were taking on a whistle-stop tour of SignalR, including loads of real world examples, that really help to drive home how SignalR could be used in practice.  If you have never been to one of Christian&rsquo;s presentation, you owe it to yourself to go along to one!</p>

<p>Great job!</p>

<p><strong>Takeaways</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Wow, just wow!  He showed how, using SignalR, you can surface changes that were made directly to the database (using SQL Server Management Studio) could be surfaced to a DataGrid running in the browser.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/chillitom/CefSharp">CEFSharp</a> - an embeddable version of Chrome that you can run in your .Net Applications</p></li>
<li><p>Suggestion that you don&rsquo;t create native applications, in the traditional sense, but rather create native apps that host a browser, and run your application there.</p></li>
<li><p>SignalR Sample Applications - Mouse Tracking - truly mind-blowing what is being done in only a few lines of code!</p></li>
<li><p>Regardless of browser, long polling will always work and will be used as fall back connection with SignalR</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Quotes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>&ldquo;If your software doesn&rsquo;t contain a DataGrid, you have failed!&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;Dynamic! Ah, can you feel this?&rdquo; - you had to be there to appreciate this one!</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>Overall Thoughts</h1>

<p>Another great day of sessions, made all the better by winning a Surface RT!  Looking forward to more sessions tomorrow!</p>

</ul>


<p>In this the 16th year of DevWeek, Dave Wheeler was meant to be doing the Keynote presentation, however, due to suffering a back injury, Kevlin Henney and Steve Plank, stepped in to do two sessions for the Keynote.</p>

<h1>First Morning Session</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/kevlinhenney">Kevlin Henney</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/plankytronixx">Steve Plank</a></p>

<p><strong>Topic: </strong>&ldquo;A Question of Craftsmanship&rdquo; and &ldquo;Advances in Cloud Computing Platform&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>Personally, I thought that these were two very good sessions.  Kevlin&rsquo;s gave a very thought-provoking discussion about thinking about code as art, and how we should be ensuring that we strive to create the best code possible.  And Steve gave a great demo of how complicated systems can be configured and deployed in Windows Azure.  I also really liked Steve&rsquo;s slides, which really have to be seen to be understood.  They were essentially drawings, which were created as he was speaking.</p>

<p>While leaving the room, I heard some mumblings from some other delegates that the second talk was a sales pitch, but I really don&rsquo;t think that this was how it was intended.  I guess you can&rsquo;t please everyone!</p>

<p><strong>Takeaways</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Is code art?</p>

<h1>Second Morning Session</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Kevin Jones (you can find him on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinrjones">here</a> and on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/kevinrjones">here</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Topic: </strong>Building interactive clients with knockout.js</p>

<blockquote>Client side development in the browser is becoming more and more important. Clients expect highly interactive applications that respond quickly to changes. To manage this developers have to cope with the demands of JavaScript. While jQuery is a fantastic tool, sometimes it feels too low-level and maybe needs something layered on top. One such layering is knockout.js. This provides an MVVM programming model for the browser. This talk looks briefly at the basis for MVVM and then into the details of knockout.js. We will cover the data-binding that is at the heart of this toolkit looking for example at how knockout does data updates and computed values. We will also see how knockout can work with your server-side coding.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>I went to Kevin&rsquo;s full day session on Unit Testing at last years DevWeek so I knew that he is a great speaker, and I am happy to say that again, I was not disappointed.  Through a number of examples, each building on top of each other, we were provided with a very good introduction to what knockout.js is, and how it can be used.</p>

<p>At one point, Kevin seemed to go off on a bit of tangent when trying to describe a particular situation, when his demo didn&rsquo;t do what he expected.  He was able to turn this around very well though, and the end result was a discussion about using &ldquo;debugger&rdquo; on the click event of any bound element to step into the JavaScript debugger of the browser you are using to enable you to figure out exactly what is going on, and what contexts are being used by knockout.js.  This was the number one takeaway from this session.  This technique is described in this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9261296/any-good-techniques-to-debug-template-binding-faults-for-knockout-js">StackOverflow question</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Takeaways</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Two way bindings, by default, are applied with you tab off an element, i.e. lostFocus, but this can be changed</p></li>
<li><p>i.e. you can use valueUpdate binding with a value of say afterKeyDown</p></li>
<li><p>Knockout.js intellisense is coming in Visual Studio 2012 Update 2</p></li>
<li><p>When using a foreach binding, no HTML will be rendered if the collection is empty</p></li>
<li><p>There is a mapping plugin for knockout.js with helps with mapping to and from JSON when communicating with the server</p></li>
<li><p>It is possible to create your own extensions for knockout.js</p></li>
<li><p>There is a validation extension for knockout.js</p></li>
<li><p>I believe that the code used in this session will be put <a href="https://github.com/kevinrjones/DevWeek2013">here</a> in Kevin&rsquo;s github repo</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Quotes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>&ldquo;jQuery is non trivial to use, but I love it like a brother&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;If your heart gives out, I am not responsible&rdquo; - when discussing the amazing HTML interface that he was creating</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>First Afternoon Session</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Scott Allen (you can find his blog <a href="http://odetocode.com/blogs/all">here</a>, and twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/OdeToCode">here</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Topic: </strong>The new world of HTML5 and CSS3</p>

<blockquote>WebSockets, Webworkers, animations, transitions, and SVG. These are just a few of the new capabilities we can use to build applications with modern browsers.
In this session we’ll give overviews and demonstrations of these new features and see how to build applications with the latest standards.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>This was a very good talk.  Scott&rsquo;s laid back approach to presenting makes it very easy to get absorbed in what he is saying, and you don&rsquo;t realise where the time goes!  The 90 minutes were up very quickly!</p>

<p>The only thing that I would say is there was a lot of jumping between the PowerPoint version of his slides, and an HTML version of his slides.  I think he could have quite easily done the entire presentation from the HTML version, rather than just showing the demos from the HTML version.  Not sure why he took the decision to do it this way.</p>

<p><strong>Takeaways</strong></p>

<p>Throughout this talk, there were a number of sites that were shown that really help you get started with HTML5 and CSS3, so some of the below are simply links to these sites.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://caniuse.com/">http://caniuse.com/</a> - very cool site which shows which elements are supported in which browsers</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://html5test.com/">http://html5test.com/</a> - provides a score for browsers in terms of how well they implement HTML5.  For instance, at the time of writing, Chrome scores 463.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">http://html5boilerplate.com/</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.css3.info/preview/">http://www.css3.info/preview/</a> - site showing how CSS3 can be used</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2009/redesigning-with-html-5-wai-aria/">Interesting post about HTML5</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts">Google Fonts</a> - a site to provide the necessary CSS to enable certain fonts on your site</p></li>
<li><p>Declare the language encoding that your site uses as early as possible in the page</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://thehtml5quiz.com/">http://thehtml5quiz.com/</a> - how many html elements can you name in 5 minutes?</p></li>
<li><p>HTML 5 video tag doesn&rsquo;t support DRM</p></li>
<li><p>For debugging WebSockets, you can&rsquo;t use fiddler right now, you would need to use something like WireShark</p></li>

</ul>


<h1>Second Afternoon Session</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Andrew Clymer (you can find his blog <a href="http://andyclymer.blogspot.co.uk/">here</a>, and twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewclymer">here</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Topic: </strong>Taking advantage of C# 5 async/await</p>

<blockquote>.NET 4 introduced the new ‘task’ abstraction, and C# 5 will take advantage of integrating this into the language via the async and await keywords. Furthermore, the new task abstraction promotes a new way of architecting asynchronous behaviour; in this talk we will explore how to take advantage of these new keywords and other new types and features being exposed in the next version of .NET to deliver far simpler asynchronous Windows UI&#8217;s.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>I was very much looking forward to this talk.  I have seen the usage of async/await before, and I have played with it in a Windows Phone application that I was creating, but I was interested to find out more about it.  There was no faulting the speakers knowledge on the subject, it was excellent, however, there were a couple of things about the talk that were slightly off-putting for me.</p>

<p>Firstly, the use of a second person, Richard Blewett, on stage to drive the transition of the slides, and also to generate the code.  For me, this didn&rsquo;t really work.  Rich was using Andrew&rsquo;s laptop that had a different configuration than he was used to which meant that there were problems when building and running code.</p>

<p>Secondly, when requesting that a slide be moved to the next one, there was a click of the fingers, which again for me, was quite off-putting.</p>

<p><strong>Takeaways</strong></p>

<p>There were actually some really interesting takeaways from this session.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I really liked how the history of asynchronous methods have changed through the different version of the .Net Framework</p></li>
<li><p>Anything that takes longer than 15ms to complete shouldn&rsquo;t be done on the UI thread</p></li>
<li><p>You can only use the new async key word on a method that returns a void, or a Task<T></p></li>
<li><p>Using async/await makes the compiler do the work of creating the continuations that you would have otherwise have to create yourself</p></li>
<li><p>There are techniques to use CancellationTokenSource and IProgress to provide updates back to the UI and to control execution of the Task</p></li>
<li><p>Whenever you are using a thread, whether in UI code, or on the server, you should look to implementing async/await to release threads when not being used.</p></li>
<li><p>I am expecting that the code for the presentation will be available <a href="http://rocksolidknowledge.com/Conferences.mvc/">here</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Quotes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>&ldquo;If an application doesn&rsquo;t respond, hit it harder, just like the kids, they respond to that&rdquo; - said jokingly when discussing the lack of response from the UI when blocked by executing code</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;She can crack an iPhone screen with her finger&rdquo; - again, when discussing the frustration felt by users when waiting on a non-responsive UI</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>Overall Thoughts</h1>

<p>As always, a very well executed day at DevWeek.  Everything seemed to run very smoothly.  The venue is amazing (even though it is a bit of a hike from the exhibition area to some of the rooms for talks), and the food for lunch and breaks is excellent.  Looking forward to tomorrow.  I took a few pictures on my phone, which you can see below:</p>

		<h1>Day 1 of DevWeek - SharePoint</h1>

<p>Today was the first day of <a href="http://www.devweek.com/">DevWeek 2013</a>, and once again, I am happy to say that it was a great day.  As some of you will be aware, I attended <a href="http://gep13.me/VhBYfB">DevWeek last year</a>, and I got a lot out of it.  When I got the opportunity to attend again, I jumped at it.  In the same way as I did last year, I intend to write a blog post about each day, with thoughts, takeaways, and various links to interesting things that come up during the days.  Luckily, in the same way as last year, I will be attending the entire week of DevWeek.</p>

<p>Review of the other days of DevWeek can be seen here:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://gep13.me/W0AJEP">Day 1 - Pre-Conference Workshop</a> (this post)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://gep13.me/YuOPy2">Day 2 - Conference Sessions</a></p></li>

</ul>


<h1>Pre-Conference Workshop at DevWeek</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Sahil Malik (you can find his blog <a href="http://blah.winsmarts.com/">here</a>, and twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/sahilmalik">here</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Topic:</strong> SharePoint 2013 workshop for developers</p>

<blockquote>Join us for a full day of SharePoint 2013 goodness. SharePoint 2013 has some remarkable improvements as compared to SharePoint 2010.
This day covers what you need to know about SharePoint 2013 as a SharePoint 2010 or 2007 developer. It also covers what you need to know as an ASP.NET developer to get a quick on-ramp to SharePoint 2013.
Overall we’ll aim to provide a comprehensive overview of what’s new in SharePoint 2013 in various areas, including apps, client-side technologies, security, BCS, workflows, WCM and internet facing sites, mobile development, search, and Business Intelligence.</blockquote>


<h1>Thoughts</h1>

<p>Due to the fact that we use SharePoint 2010 in-house, I was very interested to see what new functionality, abilities, modifications, etc, were coming with SharePoint 2013.  This is not an area that I have spent a lot of time looking into (there are no immediate plans to upgrade), but I was still very interested to hear what Sahil had to say.  I am very happy to say that I was not disappointed.</p>

<p>Sahil took us on a very fast paced, but interesting trip through:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What there was in 2010 and earlier</p></li>
<li><p>What was good</p></li>
<li><p>What was bad</p></li>
<li><p>What is new in 2013</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The session was incredibly fast based, but this was due mainly to the sheer amount of content that Sahil had.  Although there was a lot to take in, Sahil did a great job of ensuring that everyone was following along, and also stopped to take questions from the audience when required.</p>

<p>All in all, it was a great session, that has left a lot to think about.  There are a number of key features in SharePoint 2013 that I could see being very useful in our current development efforts.</p>

<h1>Takeaways</h1>

<p>There were lots of interesting topics discussed in this whirlwind discussion on everything regarding SharePoint 2013, but some of the main takeaways were:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Claims Based Authentication is the default in SharePoint 2013.  You can enable the &ldquo;old style&rdquo; authentication, but this will only affect the SharePoint Portal.  Behind the scenes, everything else will still be Claims Based, so it will need to be embraced.</p></li>
<li><p>SharePoint 2013 now using .Net Framework 4.5.  Hallelujah!!</p></li>
<li><p>All workflows authored in SharePoint are now housed within the Workflow Management Site&#8221;, which can be farmed off onto its own server.</p></li>
<li><p>Some &ldquo;stsadm&rdquo; commands that worked in SharePoint 2010, may no longer work in 2013.  The guidance is to use the SharePoint PowerShell Interface instead.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/powershell/archive/2012/06/27/windows-powershell-web-access-basic-installation-guide.aspx">PowerShell Web Access</a> - Very cool!</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fp161259.aspx">Test-SPSite</a> and <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fp161269.aspx">Repair-SPSite</a> - A great idea!  Especially since the tests that you can run are extensible!</p></li>
<li><p>In the new SharePoint model, both Application Pages and Site Pages run under Full Trust, regardless of CAS policies.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/jj220038.aspx">NAPA Office 365 Development Tools</a> - You can use a SharePoint 2013 App (authored by Microsoft) to create other SharePoint 2013 Apps</p></li>
<li><p>The Client Side Object Model and ReST API for SharePoint 2013 has been completely overhauled.  Now much nicer to work with!</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>Quotes</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>&ldquo;SharePoint teaches you a lot of patience!&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;Working on it&hellip;&rdquo; - this the new &ldquo;loading&rdquo; message that comes up whenever SharePoint is busy</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>Book Recommendations</h1>

<p>Sahil is the author of a number of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Ddigital-text&amp;field-keywords=sahil+malik&amp;rh=n%3A341677031%2Ck%3Asahil+malik">books</a>, but he has recently created a couple of new ones, which are only being released electronically.  He explained that this was for a couple of reasons, i.e. he can release updates to the book when there are some, and it also means that the cost of the books are less.  The new books can be found below (I have just bought them both)</p>

		<h1>It&rsquo;s a snap!</h1>

<p>If you have decided to <a href="http://gep13.me/VAeRiX">install your own instance of TeamCity</a>, then it is your responsibility to ensure that it is kept up to date.  <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/">JetBrains</a> have a fairly aggressive <a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TW/Previous+Releases+Downloads">release cadence</a>, with updates coming out every couple of months.  This is great, as you get a host of new features and bug fixes on a regular basis.</p>

<p>When performing an upgrade, the most important thing to do is to back up the database and configuration settings.  Luckily, this is a built-in process within the administration section of TeamCity.</p>

<p>This blog post steps through the full upgrade process.</p>

<h1>Installation Steps</h1>

<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>The following installation steps and screenshots were taken from a virtual machine   with Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1, running in Hyper-V on a Windows 8 Host Machine.</p>

<p>These instructions are specific to version 7.1.3 of TeamCity, however, later versions will likely follow very similar steps.  In addition, these installation instructions will install both the TeamCity Server and Build Agent onto the same machine.  Ideally, you would want to have a separate Build Agent Machine.</p>

<p>You can see screenshots of each of these steps in the galley at the bottom of this blog post.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Assumption is that you already have <a href="http://gep13.me/VAeRiX">TeamCity</a> installed (otherwise, why would you be looking to upgrade it :-)</p></li>
<li><p>Assumption is that you have already <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/download/index.html">downloaded the new version of TeamCity</a>, in this case 7.1.4.</p></li>
<li><p>Log into TeamCity using an account that has Administrator privileges</p></li>
<li><p>Click on the Backup link near the bottom left hand corner</p></li>
<li><p>When the Run Backup Tab opens, click on &ldquo;Start Backup&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>The backup should complete successfully</p></li>
<li><p>Double Click the installation *.exe which was downloaded in Step 2 above</p></li>
<li><p>At the first step in the installation wizard simply click Next</p></li>
<li><p>Read the License Agreement and assuming you are happy with it, click “I Agree”</p></li>
<li><p>In the “Choose Install Location” window, assuming you are happy with the default installation folder, simply click Next, otherwise change it first</p></li>
<li><p>In order to install the latest version of TeamCity, you have to first uninstall the current version.  Click &ldquo;Next&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>On this screen simply click Next once the current installation has been located</p></li>
<li><p>Typically, since you are doing an upgrade, you want to keep both the build configuration and working directory, but the log files can be removed.  Click Uninstall</p></li>
<li><p>The un-installation will continue</p></li>
<li><p>After a short period, the un-installation will complete</p></li>
<li><p>In the “Choose Components” window choose the components that you want to install.  As already mentioned, we will be installing both the Server and Build Agent on one server.  Click Next</p></li>
<li><p>In the “Specify server configuration directory” window assuming you are happy with the default location click Next, otherwise change it first</p></li>
<li><p>The main portion of the installation will start now</p></li>
<li><p>The “Configure Build Agent Properties” window will then open, giving you the opportunity to add/edit build agent properties.  For now, you can leave this as the default.  If needed, this can be changed later.  Click Save.</p></li>
<li><p>Simply click OK on the “TeamCity Build Agent Properties” pop-up</p></li>
<li><p>In the “Select Service Account for Server” window decide what user account you want to run the TeamCity Server, I chose to use the SYSTEM account.  Click Next</p></li>
<li><p>In the “Select Service Account for Agent” window decide what user account you want to run the TeamCity Build Agent, I chose to use the SYSTEM account.  Click Next</p></li>
<li><p>In the “Services” window, choose to start both the Server and Build Agent Services, and click Next</p></li>
<li><p>In the final screen, ensure that the option to open TeamCity Website after exit is checked and click Finish.</p></li>
<li><p>A web page will open saying “TeamCity is starting”</p></li>
<li><p>The login screen will then be presented</p></li>
<li><p>On logging in, you will see the latest version number displayed</p></li>
</ol>
