	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/google-chrome-search-for-msdn/" itemprop="url">Google Chrome Search for MSDN</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Like most developers, on a day to day basis I consult the online MSDN library in order to look at a class that I need to find out more information about. Whether it is a Property that I need to find out about, or an Event that is raised by the Class, or a Method that I need to call on the class.</p>

<p>In order to optimise the time that it takes to do that search, like many others, I use Google. This is made even easier with Google Chrome, and the introduction of its OmniBox. However, searching simply on the class name, such as “HttpContext” or “String” doesn’t always cut it, as you will get a wealth of other results returned. What you need to do is to add additional information to refine that search, such as “HttpContext Class MSDN”. In doing this, you (normally) always get the result as the first result. However, what do you need to do after that? You need to click on the link. How tedious is that?</p>

<p>The solution?</p>

<p>Combine the power of Google Chrome with the power of the Google Search Engine and it’s “I’m Feeling Lucky” search. Here are the steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Open Google Chrome</p></li>
<li><p>Click the Options spanner at the top right, and select “Options”</p></li>
</ol>


<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/image.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/image_thumb.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<ol>
<li>Select the “Basics” tab, and click the “Manage” button</li>
</ol>


<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/image1.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/image_thumb1.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<ol>
<li>Click the “Add” button</li>
</ol>


<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/image2.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/image_thumb2.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<ol>
<li><p>In the dialog box that opens, enter the following values:</p></li>
<li><p>MSDN Search</p></li>
<li>msdn</li>
<li><a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?btnI=I'm+Feeling+Lucky&amp;q=%s+Class+MSDN">http://www.google.co.uk/search?btnI=I&rsquo;m+Feeling+Lucky&amp;q=%s+Class+MSDN</a></li>
</ol>


<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/image3.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/image_thumb3.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>All that is being done here is using the search string that was used early, i.e. HttpContext Class MSDN (you can replace this with anything that you find more appropriate, but this works for me), and using a %s instead of HttpContext to allow the replacement of it with a Class name that we are actually interested in.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Click Ok</p></li>
<li><p>Click Close</p></li>
<li><p>Click Close</p></li>
<li><p>Go into the OmniBox, and type msdn, followed by the tab key (this will initiate the custom msdn search that we just created, then simply type the class name that you are interested in, i.e. HttpContext</p></li>
</ol>


<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/image4.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/image_thumb4.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<ol>
<li>Hit enter, the HttpContext Class on the MSDN Library page opens up.
<strong><em>Suggested Alternatives</em></strong>  If you are always interested in the Properties for a class, you could modify the search string to be “HttpContext Properties MSDN”. This should then take you straight to the Properties page for that class. The same is true if you want the Events, Methods, or the Constructor.  The trick is making the search string unique enough to return the entry that you are after as the first result (which isn’t all that difficult. This technique means that you don’t then have to enter that search string each time.</li>
</ol>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Now that I have fully consolidated my music collection onto my VERY impressive <a href="http://www.synology.com/us/products/ds410/index.php">Synology Server</a>, I thought it was about time that I dug out my classic iPod so that I could stand listening to music at work.  Whilst doing this, I was introduced to a very useful tip.</p>

<p>Basically, due to restrictions imposed on our machines at work, we are not allowed to have iTunes installed.  As a result, when I went to plug my iPod into my computer (hoping to be able to charge the device, whilst still listening to it), I was met with an error, and all I got from the iPod itself was the icon indicating that it was trying to connect to the computer.  I wasn’t able to charge the iPod!</p>

<p>However, the solution is simple.</p>

<p>Go to Start | My computer and find the drive that is your iPod.  Simply right click on the drive, and then select Eject.  This has the result of stopping the iPod trying to communicate with the computer, allowing you to listen to whatever music you want to, but it will continue to charge from your computer.</p>

<p>The best of both worlds!</p>

		<p>As some of you will know, I have a lifetime subscription to the following site:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.learnvisualstudio.net/">http://www.learnvisualstudio.net/</a></p>

<p>They have recently released to new video series.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.learnvisualstudio.net/content/series/Windows_Phone_7_Development_for_Absolute_Beginners.aspx">Windows Phone 7 Development for Absolute Beginners</a></p>

<p>and</p>

<p><a href="http://www.learnvisualstudio.net/content/series/Silverlight_4_0_Level_1.aspx">Silverlight 4.0 – Level 1</a></p>

<p>I have now watched the first 6 videos in the WP7 series, and as usual, the quality of the videos are very good.  Bob Tabor is using a new format for his videos (at least a new format for me), in which he actually presents to the camera, as well as the usual video view of his Visual Studio instance.</p>

<p>The video series is very much aimed at the complete beginner, and begins gently with an introduction to installing the Windows Phone 7 tools, as well as getting started with the IDE, and Windows Phone Emulator.</p>

<p>If you haven’t already, I would highly recommend that you take a look at LVS.Net, they have a huge selection of videos ranging in topic and length.</p>

		<p>I have recently been working on a SharePoint Web Part, and while trying to retract the solution from SharePoint, I got an error message, shown here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Where-did-the-assemblies-from-my-Global-_13A1E/5e76c325-aa54-4408-9fe5-ca32dc405398.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Where-did-the-assemblies-from-my-Global-_13A1E/5e76c325-aa54-4408-9fe5-ca32dc405398_thumb.png" alt="5e76c325-aa54-4408-9fe5-ca32dc405398" /></a></p>

<p>Now, in all honesty, I didn’t think much of this error, because when I checked the files associated with each of the features for the solution they were all gone, and when I tried to open the home page of my SharePoint server, it worked, and everything looked to be ok. However, an additional step after retracting the solution was to remove a couple files from the GAC (yes, I know I need to alter my WSP project to do this for me, but…), on opening the GAC, I was greeted with this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Where-did-the-assemblies-from-my-Global-_13A1E/ee75f8ab-79d9-4c07-b512-09fab0b6cdc0.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Where-did-the-assemblies-from-my-Global-_13A1E/ee75f8ab-79d9-4c07-b512-09fab0b6cdc0_thumb.png" alt="ee75f8ab-79d9-4c07-b512-09fab0b6cdc0" /></a></p>

<p>Where have all my assemblies gone?!? My machine is still running, and there haven’t been any error messages pop up, so I know the files in the GAC must be there, but for whatever reason, they are not being displayed. So, what do you do in situations like this? I don’t know about you, but I always turn to the person next to me to make sure that they are seeing the same thing as me. So I did, I pulled over one of my colleagues, and asked him to look at my GAC and ask if he had seen this before. However, when I did this, and I opened the GAC again, all the files were there!! So I took some stick about being an idiot, and I went on with my day.</p>

<p>Later on though, the same thing happened. I pulled my colleague over again, and proved that I wasn’t dreaming. He agreed that he was seeing the same thing as I was (no need to call the men in white coats yet), but didn’t have a clue what was going on.</p>

<p>So, what do you do when all other avenues have been exhausted? That’s right, you Google it. I found various references to the problem, but nothing concrete, until I found this:</p>

<p><a href="http://kwizcom.blogspot.com/2009/01/global-assembly-cache-gac-folder.html">http://kwizcom.blogspot.com/2009/01/global-assembly-cache-gac-folder.html</a></p>

<p>My initial reaction was, no, that can’t be right. But to my surprise, disabling the “Indexing Service” does appear to have done the trick. I have had the retraction error a few more times since I disabled the service (I really need to look into why that is happening), and each time the GAC has remained in tact.</p>

<p>No idea what was causing this to happen, but seems like this is the solution.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/nosql-autumn-conference-2010dundee/" itemprop="url">NoSql Autumn Conference 2010–Dundee</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Yesterday I attended the NoSql Autumn Conference at Dundee University:</p>

<p><a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/nosql1/">http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/nosql1/</a></p>

<p>This included talks on <a href="http://cassandra.apache.org/">Cassandra</a> (by Andy Cobley), <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a> (by Jonathan Forbes),<a href="http://ravendb.net/">RavenDB</a> (by Rob Ashton) and <a href="http://voltdb.com/">VoltDB</a> (by Mark Whitehorn), as well as an opening session entitled “Is NoSql the future of data storage?” by Gary Short.</p>

<p>In the past I have always used Sql Server, MySql and Oracle, I have never done anything with any NoSql Systems, but I went along to this conference with an open mind to see what else was available.</p>

<p>Of the systems that were talked about, the most interesting, from my point of view, was RavenDB. This is built on C#, and uses LINQ expressions to save and retrieve information from the data store, so from a .Net Development perspective, it certainly looked like the easiest system to get up and running with. The others required the use of Java, or Erlang, neither of which I have ever played with.</p>

<p>The only “slight” issue with RavenDB is that a lot of the features that make it stand out are currently still in the unstable branch of the development. However, as the speaker, Rob, pointed out, by the time you are ready to roll out a system that uses these features, it is more than likely that these features will have been moved over to the stable branch as there is a high level of active development going on.</p>

<p>From a NoSql point of view, the concepts of Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance, (CAP) are at the heart of each system, but no one system can have each of these. They can have 2 out of the 3 only. So for instance, standard systems like SQL Server are CA, Hadoop is CP and RavenDB is AP.</p>

<p>Gary Short pretty much summed up the NoSql movement when he answered the question “Is NoSql the future of data storage?” by saying Yes, and No.</p>

<p>The concepts at the heart of NoSql make it very appealing when it comes to distributed storage and horizontal scalability, but it won’t be long before the big database manufacturers start to implement some of these concepts natively into their systems.</p>

 	</div> 

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/microsoft-app-hub-registration/" itemprop="url">Microsoft App Hub Registration</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Having got the new <a href="http://www.htc.com/uk/product/hd7/overview.html">HTC HD7</a> a couple weeks ago, I decided that I wanted to create an account with the <a href="http://create.msdn.com/">App Hub</a>. Doing so means that I can unlock the handset and make it a developer handset.</p>

<p>What this means is that applications that have been created within Visual Studio can be deployed directly to the device. Until this is done, the only way to get applications onto a handset is to download them directly from the Microsoft Marketplace.</p>

<p>Although there is an emulator within the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=04704acf-a63a-4f97-952c-8b51b34b00ce&amp;displaylang=en">Windows Phone Developer Tools</a> which allows you to debug and test applications, there are times when you simply “have” to deploy to a physical device. One of the main reasons is to get a true representation of the performance of your application. Running through the emulator on a powerful machine can give a “false” indication of the performance of the application.</p>

<p>There are a set of very specific criteria that any application you create has to abide by and before submitting our application to the Marketplace for testing you will need to verify that your application meets them.</p>

<p>App Hub registration costs £65 + VAT per year.</p>

<p>There are a number of steps that have to be completed before you can get to the stage of unlocking your handset.</p>

<p><strong><em>Step 1: Create an App Hub Account</em></strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Microsoft-App-Hub-Registration_13804/b420594f-c8cd-4c60-ba5a-54edfd9e77e3.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Microsoft-App-Hub-Registration_13804/b420594f-c8cd-4c60-ba5a-54edfd9e77e3_thumb.png" alt="b420594f-c8cd-4c60-ba5a-54edfd9e77e3" /></a></p>

<p>This will require a Windows Live ID. (If you don’ t have one, you can register <a href="https://signup.live.com/signup.aspx?lic=1">here</a>.) Go to the App Hub website and sign in.</p>

<p>If you have any problems signing into the App Hub site, first try going to the <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/live">XBox Live</a>site and signing in there. There was a known issue with the Terms and Conditions on the XBox Live site which meant you had to first accept their Terms and Conditions before being able to progress with the App Hub registration.</p>

<p>During the registration process, you will be asked whether you want to register a individual account, a Business account, or a student account. You may want to spend some time thinking about this one as once you have made the decision, you can’t change it, and you will need to create a new account with a different Windows Live ID.</p>

<p><strong><em>Step 2: Verify Email Address</em></strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Microsoft-App-Hub-Registration_13804/4c2e6ba3-be55-48a0-b64b-b11d9d4f8f5a.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Microsoft-App-Hub-Registration_13804/4c2e6ba3-be55-48a0-b64b-b11d9d4f8f5a_thumb.png" alt="4c2e6ba3-be55-48a0-b64b-b11d9d4f8f5a" /></a></p>

<p>Once you have completed Step 1, you will need to verify your email address. This can simply be achieved by clicking on the link that you will receive to the email address that you used to sign up.</p>

<p><strong><em>Step 3: GeoTrust Verification</em></strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Microsoft-App-Hub-Registration_13804/7eed2713-7369-418a-9634-2645883e8cb3.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Microsoft-App-Hub-Registration_13804/7eed2713-7369-418a-9634-2645883e8cb3_thumb.png" alt="7eed2713-7369-418a-9634-2645883e8cb3" /></a></p>

<p>The next step in the authorisation process is handed over to a Microsoft Partner called GeoTrust. This involves having to submit a photocopy/scan of a piece of photographic identification. For instance, your driving license or passport. You will be asked for this by email. This step in the process can take upwards of a few days to complete.</p>

<p><strong><em>Step 4: Unlock Phone</em></strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Microsoft-App-Hub-Registration_13804/281e82ed-9a0b-4fba-955c-d1c64663dad8.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Microsoft-App-Hub-Registration_13804/281e82ed-9a0b-4fba-955c-d1c64663dad8_thumb.png" alt="281e82ed-9a0b-4fba-955c-d1c64663dad8" /></a></p>

<p>Once GeoTrust has verified your identity you will be able to unlock your handset. (You can unlock up to 3 devices, and once unlocked you can control which devices you want to keep unlocked through your App Hub account). This step is completed by using the Windows Phone Developer Registration Tool which was installed along with the Windows Phone Developer Tools.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Microsoft-App-Hub-Registration_13804/586379f6-5f9b-4189-96db-dbaa610054cb.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Microsoft-App-Hub-Registration_13804/586379f6-5f9b-4189-96db-dbaa610054cb_thumb.png" alt="586379f6-5f9b-4189-96db-dbaa610054cb" /></a></p>

<p>However, before you will be able to connect your phone to your computer, you will have to install the <a href="http://www.zune.net/en-GB/">Zune</a> software so that your computer can communicate with the handset.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Microsoft-App-Hub-Registration_13804/df79e327-4cb3-4070-80e3-5467ba1bceb3.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Microsoft-App-Hub-Registration_13804/df79e327-4cb3-4070-80e3-5467ba1bceb3_thumb.png" alt="df79e327-4cb3-4070-80e3-5467ba1bceb3" /></a></p>

<p>Once installed, connect your handset to your computer via the USB cable, and allow the device drivers to install. Then open the developer registration tool. Make sure that your phone is switched on and open (i.e. you can see the live tiles) and then type in your Windows Live ID and password, and click Register.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Microsoft-App-Hub-Registration_13804/035af53b-cf02-4896-a835-a4c468aa2eda.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Microsoft-App-Hub-Registration_13804/035af53b-cf02-4896-a835-a4c468aa2eda_thumb.png" alt="035af53b-cf02-4896-a835-a4c468aa2eda" /></a></p>

<p><strong><em>Step 5: Verify Handset is unlocked</em></strong></p>

<p>Log into your App Hub account and go to your Windows Phone Dashboard, and click “Manage your development phones”. Here you should see the phone that you just registered.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Microsoft-App-Hub-Registration_13804/fae30ad8-d26c-4979-99bb-69f40d55cca7.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Microsoft-App-Hub-Registration_13804/fae30ad8-d26c-4979-99bb-69f40d55cca7_thumb.png" alt="fae30ad8-d26c-4979-99bb-69f40d55cca7" /></a></p>

<p>With this step completed, you will now be able to choose this option:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Microsoft-App-Hub-Registration_13804/d4453484-4c92-4033-9a52-2bed1b168765.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Microsoft-App-Hub-Registration_13804/d4453484-4c92-4033-9a52-2bed1b168765_thumb.png" alt="d4453484-4c92-4033-9a52-2bed1b168765" /></a></p>

<p>Within Visual Studio to deploy applications onto your handset.</p>

<p><strong><em>Points to note</em></strong></p>

<p>During the registration process, I received an email saying that my payment had been cancelled, however, I never cancelled it. It this happens to you, the best people to contact are the XBox Live team, as they deal with the subscription payment. You can find their contact details here:</p>

<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-GB/pages/contact-us.aspx">http://support.xbox.com/en-GB/pages/contact-us.aspx</a></p>

<p>I found their team to be very helpful, and I was quickly able to get everything straightened out.</p>

<p>You are able to upload up to 5 free applications to the Marketplace, and any number of paid for applications. However, in order to get any revenue from the Marketplace, you will have to sort out the Tax implications. I haven’t yet completed this step, but once I have figured it out, I will let you know how to do it.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/lloyds-tsb-scam-email/" itemprop="url">Lloyds TSB Scam Email</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>In the last two weeks, I have had two emails claiming to be from my Lloyds TSB online account. In them, they tell me that due to “suspicious” activity on my online account (log ins from multiple IP addresses) my account has been temporarily limited, and I need to take one of two courses of action:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Click on the provided link to log into my account and re-enable it.</p></li>
<li><p>Complete the attachment</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Now, both of the above things made me a little suspicious, but looking at the email closer, there were a few tell tale signs that this was a scam email, and that it should be deleted and not looked at.</p>

<p>Firstly, the “from” address of the email:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Lloyds-TSB-scam-email_13AAA/14a5ab8f-17fc-46c1-b602-f154010be53e.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Lloyds-TSB-scam-email_13AAA/14a5ab8f-17fc-46c1-b602-f154010be53e_thumb.png" alt="14a5ab8f-17fc-46c1-b602-f154010be53e" /></a></p>

<p>You should notice a couple things from the above:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It is from “Loyds TSB”. This is a spelling mistake, and would unlikely happen on a legitimate email.</p></li>
<li><p>The registered domain name is also incorrect @loydstsb.com</p></li>
<li><p>The user name for the email is “supporti”. Again, this is unlikely in a legitimate email.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Looking in to the body of the email, I was then presented with:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Lloyds-TSB-scam-email_13AAA/ddff2199-f268-4526-a477-59ca19a25bdb.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/Lloyds-TSB-scam-email_13AAA/ddff2199-f268-4526-a477-59ca19a25bdb_thumb.png" alt="ddff2199-f268-4526-a477-59ca19a25bdb" /></a></p>

<p>Notice here that the URL for the link goes to lloydstsb.co.uk. Although the spelling of Lloyds is correct this time, the actual URL for my Lloyds TSB account goes to lloydstsb.com. A subtle difference, but in the world of the internet, this is the difference between a legitimate site, and a bogus one.</p>

<p>Bottom line is, if you receive any emails like this, ALWAYS err on the side of caution. Don’t click any direct links from these emails, and don’t open any attachments. If in any doubt, phone your bank, or whoever is the subject of the email, they will be able to help you</p>
