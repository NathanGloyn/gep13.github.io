	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/use-the-cloud9-online-ide-to-hack-on-wordpress/" itemprop="url">Use the Cloud9 Online IDE to Hack on WordPress</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>As some of you may know, I have been <em>hacking</em> on this WordPress blog site recently.  The decision to &ldquo;improve&rdquo; this site has really come from the realisation that WordPress is actually very good at what it does, and I am going to <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/continue-using-wordpress-or-not/">continue using it for the foreseeable future</a>.  With that in mind, there were a few things that were annoying me about the site, so I started digging around the innards of WordPress to figure out what could be changed, and more importantly, how to do it.  To start with, this was done using the always useful FTP application, <a href="http://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a>.  I would download a .php file locally, make some changes to it, and then upload it again.  This cycle repeated for a few iterations, until I realised that there <em>must</em> be a better way to do this!</p>

<h1>Using the WordPress Editor</h1>

<p>Now, WordPress comes with its own built-in file editor, which gives you the ability to edit individual files.  This can be pretty much any file within WordPress, be it, plugins, themes, script files, etc.  However, the editor itself is very basic, and I quickly became annoyed at using it:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/WordPress_Editor.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/WordPress_Editor_thumb.png" alt="WordPress_Editor" /></a></p>

<h1>Using an Online IDE</h1>

<p>Then I remembered about a conversation had with Phil Leggetter (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/leggetter">@leggetter</a>) and Daniel Elliot (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/agileguy">@agileguy</a>) while I was at <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/my-impressions-of-givecampuk/">GiveCamp UK</a> last year, and the idea of using an online IDE to do the work started to become more appealing.  This would mean that I could &ldquo;hack&rdquo; on the files directly from within the browser, but still get the added benefits, such as syntax highlighting.  A quick search, and it turns out that there are lots of online IDE&rsquo;s out there.  Here are some of the ones that I tried out:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://coderun.com/ide/">coderun</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://shiftedit.net/">ShiftEdit</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://codeanywhere.net/">codeanywhere</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://c9.io/">Cloud9 IDE</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>The requirements for what I wanted were quite simple:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Be free (yes, I am a cheap skate, but for now, what I need to use it for doesn&rsquo;t warrant paying for the service)</p></li>
<li><p>Allow editing of files on a FTP Server</p></li>
<li><p>Syntax Highlighting</p></li>
<li><p>Allow private projects</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Due to requirement 1 <a href="http://coderun.com/ide/">coderun</a> was not able to be used.  Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, this is a GREAT application, and if I was looking to code full-blown ASP.Net applications in the cloud, this would definitely be one of the go to applications.  That left three applications to whittle down.</p>

<p>Although it claims to be able to do it, I couldn&rsquo;t get <a href="https://codeanywhere.net/">codeanywhere</a> to connect to my FTP Server (and this wasn&rsquo;t for want of trying) so I gave up on using that.  That left <a href="http://shiftedit.net/">ShiftEdit</a> and <a href="http://c9.io/">Cloud9 IDE</a>.</p>

<p>I played with both of these, on and off, while I was doing my hacking, and I have to say that they are both very good.  Both are free (depending on what you want to do with them), and I found it hard to choose between them.  After a good bit of consideration, I have decided to continue using <a href="http://c9.io/">Cloud9 IDE</a>.  This was for a couple of reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Although <a href="http://shiftedit.net/">ShiftEdit</a> is free (for what I wanted to do) it didn&rsquo;t offer SSL access, which was a bit of a downer</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://c9.io/">Cloud9 IDE</a> seems to be under far more active development, with exciting recent announcements about <a href="http://cloud9ide.posterous.com/windows-azure-on-cloud9">Azure integration</a></p></li>
</ol>


<p>One thing I should note about <a href="http://c9.io/">Cloud9 IDE</a>, is that in order to secure access to your projects you normally need to purchase the premium subscription, i.e:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Create_New_Project.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Create_New_Project_thumb.png" alt="Create_New_Project" /></a></p>

<p>However, when it comes to FTP projects, it is only you that gets access:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Create_New_Project_-_FTP.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Create_New_Project_-_FTP_thumb.png" alt="Create_New_Project_-_FTP" /></a></p>

<p>Now, I have to admit that other people getting access to my FTP Server was something that I was worried about, and I wanted to test to make sure that it wasn&rsquo;t publicly accessible.  To test this I sent a DM on Twitter to Phil Leggetter and asked him to try to get in, and this is what he was met with:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/denied-access.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/denied-access_thumb.png" alt="denied access" /></a></p>

<p>However, what is interesting, is that you &ldquo;can&rdquo; grant access to users through the <a href="http://c9.io/">Cloud9 IDE</a> dashboard, once they request access, which is a really nice touch:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Cloud9_Dashboard.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Cloud9_Dashboard_thumb.png" alt="Cloud9_Dashboard" /></a></p>

<p>Sorry Phil, I denied your request to join the project :).</p>

<p>All in all, this is a VERY polished application, and I would highly recommend checking it out.  The GitHub and BitBucket integration is seamless, and <em>just</em> works!  Make sure you check it out.</p>

<p>If you are interested in checking out the result of my <em>hacking </em>I have uploaded my changes to my GitHub site <a href="https://github.com/gep13/NowReadingReloaded13">here</a>.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I have just read a very interesting blog post from Barry Mooring regarding using the <a href="http://webapps.stackexchange.com/">Web Applications website</a> when you have questions about a particular application. In case you missed it, you can see the blog post <a href="http://blog.codingbadger.com/blog/2012/january/web-applications-you-are-looking-in-the-wrong-place/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Barry makes a really good point about tailoring the place that you are searching for an answer to your question, to the place that will most likely have the answer to your question, rather than simply a blanket Google search. This in itself is a great idea.</p>

<p>However, there is one thing that I think is missing from Barry’s post though (sorry Barry, in no way a criticism <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/wlEmoticon-smile5.png" alt="Smile" />), and that is first of all going to the Web Applications website to then do your search. Personally, I would prefer to set up a Custom Search Engine within Google Chrome, rather than first navigating to the site. I do this all the time for things that I find myself doing over and over again. For instance, I have a Custom Google Search Engine for <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/google-chrome-search-for-msdn/">finding information on MSDN</a> (NOTE: This blog post needs updating to the latest version of Google Chrome, but you get the idea). And the same thing can be done for Web Applications:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Custom_Google_Search.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Custom_Google_Search_thumb.png" alt="Custom_Google_Search" /></a></p>

<p>Here I have added a Search Engine with the following settings:</p>

<p>  <table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="628" ><tbody >       <tr >       <br/>
<td width="200" valign="top" >Name:
</td>        <br/>
<td width="426" valign="top" >Web Applications
</td>       </tr>        <tr >       <br/>
<td width="200" valign="top" >Keyword:
</td>        <br/>
<td width="426" valign="top" >webapp
</td>       </tr>        <tr >       <br/>
<td width="200" valign="top" >URL:
</td>        <br/>
<td width="426" valign="top" ><a href="http://webapps.stackexchange.com/search?q=%s">http://webapps.stackexchange.com/search?q=%s</a>
</td>       </tr>     </tbody></table></p>

<p>This means that in the Google Chrome Omnibox I can simply type:</p>

<blockquote>  
> 
> webapp <then the tab key> &#8220;What you want to search for” <then press the enter key>
> 
> </blockquote>


<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Web_Application_Search.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Web_Application_Search_thumb.png" alt="Web_Application_Search" /></a></p>

<p>This has the benefit of doing the search, and the navigation to the website in one action, rather than two.</p>

<p>Personally, this is a much better flow for me, and one that I use on a daily basis. I highly recommend that you sit back and look at things you are doing over and over again, and look for ways that you can optimize this.</p>

<p>For sites that don’t have a their search page available on the query string, you can use Google’s built in function to limit the search to a specific domain. For instance, over at VBForums, I can use the following Custom Search Engine:</p>

<p> <table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="817" ><tbody >     <tr >     <br/>
<td width="200" valign="top" >Name:
</td>      <br/>
<td width="615" valign="top" >VBForums
</td>     </tr>      <tr >     <br/>
<td width="200" valign="top" >Keyword:
</td>      <br/>
<td width="615" valign="top" >vbforums
</td>     </tr>      <tr >     <br/>
<td width="200" valign="top" >URL:
</td>      <br/>
<td width="615" valign="top" ><a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=site:vbforums.com+%s">http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=site:vbforums.com+%s</a>
</td>     </tr>   </tbody></table></p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>As a birthday gift last year I was given a 4 hour Photography Training Course with Apex Photographics (thank you again Caroline!).  You can find their website <a href="http://apexphotographics.co.uk/">here</a>.  After finally sitting down to decide when I will be doing this course, I have decided to go along on Monday 6th February.  I had originally booked it for Saturday 4th, but due to the fact that I am now attending <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/i-am-attending-the-uk-tech-days-in-london/">UK Tech Days</a> in London, I am not able to make it at the weekend.  I have no idea what to expect from the course, as I haven’t taken any proper pictures for a long time now (you can see some of my efforts on flickr <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gep13/">here</a>), but I am very much looking forward to learning something new.  I will post back once I have attended the tuition, and I will upload some of the photos that I take.</p>

<p>On another note, after hearing the news that the Nikon <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/photography-video-capture/cameras/nikon-d700-d300s-discontinued-1057814?src=rss&amp;attr=all">D700 is being discontinued</a>, now is maybe a good time to start thinking about a new camera as well <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/wlEmoticon-smile4.png" alt="Smile" /></p>

		<p>Today I saw some tweets on Twitter hinting at the fact that a new update was available for Windows Phone, so when I got home tonight I plugged my HTC HD7 phone into my laptop, and sure enough, there was an update available!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/1._Update_Available.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/1._Update_Available_thumb.png" alt="1._Update_Available" /></a></p>

<p>Clicking on update presented me with more information about this update:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2._Update_Your_Phone.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2._Update_Your_Phone_thumb.png" alt="2._Update_Your_Phone" /></a></p>

<p>In case it is not clear from the picture this update includes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Fixes an on-screen keyboard issue to prevent the keyboard from disappearing during typing.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixes a Gmail syncing issue.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixes a location access issue. With this fix, the Me feature in the People Hub sends anonymous information about nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers to Microsoft only if you agree to allow the Check In function to access and use location information.</p></li>
<li><p>Revokes digital certificates from DigiCert Sdn Bhd to address an encryption issue.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixes an email issue related to Microsoft Exchange Server 2003. With this fix, when you reply to or forward a message, the original message is now included in your response.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixes a voicemail notification issue.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>For full information about this update, be sure to check out the site <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/howto/wp7/basics/update-history.aspx">here</a>.</p>

<p>After doing a quick check that everything was ready to go, I opted to start the update. Thankfully, the installer reminded me of this important fact:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/3._Plug_in_computer.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/3._Plug_in_computer_thumb.png" alt="3._Plug_in_computer" /></a></p>

<p>10 steps and 30 minutes later, I had a newly updated phone (the majority of this time was spent backing up the phone before applying the update).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/5._Success.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/5._Success_thumb.png" alt="5._Success" /></a></p>

<p>With this update in place, I am happy to report that I am now able to connect to my wireless internet connection in the house. I was previously having issues with this following the last update.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/i-am-attending-the-uk-tech-days-in-london/" itemprop="url">I Am Attending the UK Tech Days in London</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>With reference to my <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=571">list of events here</a>, I am happy to say that today I finished getting everything booked for attending the UK Tech Days, in London in February.</p>

<p>Microsoft are putting on two events:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://uktechdays.cloudapp.net/upcoming-events/windows-azure-bootcamp-(london">Windows Azure Bootcamp – 3rd February 2012</a>.aspx)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://uktechdays.cloudapp.net/upcoming-events/windows-phone-camp-(london">Windows Phone Camp – 4th February 2012</a>.aspx)</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>NOTE: If you can’t make the London events, the events are being repeated in Bristol the following week. Information <a href="http://uktechdays.cloudapp.net/upcoming-events/windows-azure-bootcamp-(bristol">here</a>.aspx) and <a href="http://uktechdays.cloudapp.net/upcoming-events/windows-phone-camp-(bristol">here</a>.aspx).</strong></p>

<p>Now that the hassle of getting the flights etc. booked has passed, I am very much looking forward to both of these events!</p>

<p>With the exception of a review that I did for a devFusion article, which made use of Windows Azure, I haven’t done anything with it. I am very interested to learn <em>exactly </em>what it is, how and where it can be used, and also how easily it can be integrated into existing applications. For instance, I recently saw this new <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/windows-azure-storage/">WordPress plugin</a> from Microsoft. This type of integration is very interesting, and I am curious to see how this could work elsewhere.</p>

<p>I have been “dabbling” with Windows Phone 7 for a while now, but I haven’t given it the attention that it needs to learn it properly, and I am hoping that the Windows Phone Bootcamp will be the kick-start that is required. After all, I have the developer account ready and waiting, just no applications to push onto the Marketplace. In addition, I will also get the opportunity to finally meet Pete Vickers (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/petevick">@petevick</a>) from <a href="http://appamundi.com/">AppaMundi</a> in person. I have “known” Pete for a while now as he hangs out on the Mobile Development Forums over at <a href="http://www.vbforums.com/forumdisplay.php?f=70">VBForums</a>, and it will be great to catch up at the event.</p>

<p>If you are thinking about attending these events I would strongly encourage you to get registered as soon as possible as some of them have gone to the waiting list stage and you may miss out.</p>

<p>If you are not able to make it, keep an eye on this blog as I intend to do posts over the course of the weekend, so hopefully I can keep you up to date with what I learn while I am there.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>As most of you will know, I have been a long time fan of the author Stuart MacBride. As shown <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=725">here</a>, <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=727">here</a> and <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=399">here</a>.</p>

<p>After I got the new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0007344171/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0007344171">Birthdays for the Dead</a>, delivered, I found out that Stuart was going to be doing a book signing at the local WHSmith in Aberdeen. Book in hand, I decided that I would go along to the book signing. (I have to admit that I checked first in order to make sure that bringing a book that I had already purchased into the book store, but I was told that this would be ok, but I took the receipt just to be on the safe side <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/wlEmoticon-smile3.png" alt="Smile" />). Although not ideal for me, I am happy to report that the queue for getting the book signed was massive. I knew that Stuart was a popular author in the North East, but to get such a turn out was great to see. Congratulations!</p>

<p>With some time to kill while I was in the queue, I started to read the book, and I have to say, so far so good <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/wlEmoticon-smile3.png" alt="Smile" />. I will keep you posted on how it goes.</p>

<p>For those interested, here is the result of waiting in the queue:</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/continue-using-wordpress-or-not/" itemprop="url">Continue Using WordPress, or Not?</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>In one way or another, I have had a blog since the start of 2008. This started out as a custom blog with I created in ASP.Net. This was hosted on my own server in the house, using Red Hat Linux, MySQL and Mono (using the mod_mono Apache Module). This was set up as more of an experiment than anything, just to prove that you could happily run an ASP.Net application on top of Linux, and by the start of 2009 I wasn’t really using the blog anymore. Back in May 2011, I decided that I wanted to start blogging “properly” again. This decision was taken for a number of reasons, but mainly due to the fact that I had started getting more involved in the UK .Net Development Community and I wanted somewhere to record what was going on, and so this WordPress blog was born.</p>

<p>Being a .Net Developer, my intention was always to start using one of the .Net Blogging systems such as <a href="http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/">BlogEngine</a>, <a href="http://dasblog.info/">dasBlog</a>, or <a href="http://subtextproject.com/default.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1">Subtext</a>, however, due to time constraints at the time, I set up this WordPress blog. This was ridiculously simple to do, and I was very quickly able to set up the blog as I wanted it, with pages, contact form, and blog entries. There was very little that I could fault with WordPress. The sheer volume of plugins that it has means that if you want to add something to your blog, such as Galleries, Comment Management, Syntax Highlighting, you can simply add it. And, best of all, normally, this doesn’t cost you anything.</p>

<p>For the next year or so, I was quite happy using the WordPress system, and it wasn’t until I set up the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group site with <a href="http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/">BlogEngine</a>, that I started to wonder whether I wanted to move this blog onto another system. I started doing some investigation, and there are a number of tutorials out there that show you the steps that you need to take in order to migrate a WordPress blog onto another system. The more I thought about it, the more I thought that I was going to go ahead and move it. At least that way, if there was “something” that I wanted to add to the blog system, be it another module, or function, then in theory (given that I am a .Net Developer and that a new system would be based on .Net) I should quite easily be able to add it.</p>

<p>However, recently, a number of things have happened that are making me to rethink this decision.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I attended <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=569">GiveCamp UK</a> and worked on a WordPress site and I got to see more into the innards of WordPress and saw that it isn’t that “bad” to tinker with, as I had previously thought</p></li>
<li><p>I found an amazing Metro WordPress Theme thanks to <a href="http://www.pedrolamas.com/2011/12/21/metro-cimbalino-wordpress-theme/">Pedro Lamas</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=416">WordPress 3.3.1</a> was released and it is quite simply, amazing!</p></li>
<li><p>I installed a few new WordPress Plugins that contained the last remaining functionality that I was looking for on my blog, namely <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/backupwordpress/">BackUpWordPress</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/disqus-comment-system/">Disqus Comment System</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/feedburner-setting/">FeedBurner FeedSmith Extend</a>, <a href="http://alexrabe.de/wordpress-plugins/nextgen-gallery/">NextGen Gallery</a>, and <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/now-reading-reloaded/">Now Reading Reloaded</a>, (If you are interested in seeing all the WordPress plugins that I currently use, take a look at this <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=174">blog post</a>).</p></li>
</ol>


<p>The Now Reading plugin doesn’t “quite” do exactly what I want, but I think I am now prepared to invest the time to get it working the way I want it.</p>

<p>So what does all this mean?</p>

<p>Unless someone can convince me to the contrary, I am going to continue using WordPress.</p>

<p>It is VERY good at what it does, and I don’t see any killer feature in any of the other systems that would make me want to switch. Granted, it is created in PHP, and this is not something that I am overly familiar with, but using it also forces me to get my toes wet with PHP, which when it comes to becoming a “well-rounded” developer is far from a bad thing. To this end, over the last week or so I have added a few more things to the blog. This includes, as mentioned, the Now Reading plugin which you can see in action <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?now_reading_library=true">here</a> (expect to see some changes to this in the near future), and I have added some photo albums, which you can see <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?page_id=581">here</a>. The majority of these photos come from my old blog back in 2008 (I have also imported the old blog posts from that blog into this one). If anyone is looking for an explanation of what the hell “<strong>Gary The Coconut</strong>” is all about, check out this blog post <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=698">here</a> and <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=694">here</a>.</p>

<p>As always, I would be interested to hear your thoughts on this, so feel free to comment.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/now-using-feedburner-for-blog-site/" itemprop="url">Now Using Feedburner for Blog Site</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I have decided to start using <a href="http://feedburner.google.com/">FeedBurner</a> for managing the Feeds for my blog (If you are not familiar with what FeedBurner is, you can find some more information <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FeedBurner">here</a>). Basically, it will allow me, on top of the Google Analytics that I already have running, to monitor how many people (if any) are actually looking at my blog.</p>

<p>The installation and setup of FeedBurner actually turned out to be quite simple. The one thing that I was worried about was previously subscribed RSS readers not working after the switch. However, with the help of the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/feedburner-setting/">FeedBurner FeedSmith Extend</a> plugin for WordPress, this is all taken care of (and it is actually recommended by FeedBurner during the setup phase. With that in place, and the feeds configured in my FeedBurner account, it all seemed to be working. On top of this, I then chose to create a custom CNAME entry in my domains DNS Records so that I could use:</p>

<blockquote>  
> 
> feeds.gep13.co.uk
> 
> </blockquote>


<p>rather then</p>

<blockquote>  
> 
> feeds.feedburner.com
> 
> </blockquote>


<p>This is very small change, but it helps to keep everything “tidy”, and again, it was very simple to setup and configure.</p>

<p>If you actually subscribe to my blog, there should be nothing for you to do, everything should continue to work as it did before. The redirect to the FeedBurner proxy happens with the help of the WordPress plugin I am using. If you have any problems, and for some reason the RSS Feed is no longer working, then I would be interested to hear from you so that I can figure out what is going on. Thanks!</p>
