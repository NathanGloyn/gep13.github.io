<h1>DDDSW Speaker Feedback Results are in</h1>

<p>Last week the speakers at DDDSW received their feedback evaluations forms, myself included.</p>

<p>Now, I have to say that I was a bit nervous about getting these feedback forms as this was my first time doing a session at a conference the size DDDSW, However, I am happy to report that I am VERY happy with the results. Thank you to everyone who attended my session, and who provided the valuable feedback on my session. I will take all of your comments away, and try to improve this session going forward. It is clear from the feedback that the session was rushed towards the end, and this was due to the fact that I was over-running slightly. I will have to look at the content and move some things around in order to make the timings better.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>While preparing for my <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/dddsw-4-stylecop-breaking-down-the-barriers-to-entry/">StyleCop presentation at DDDSW</a> I created a number of scripts for the demos that I wanted to show during the presentation.  For the first demo, which was a simple introduction to what StyleCop is and how it can be used, the script went like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Create new Windows Forms Application using C#</p></li>
<li><p>Show that the Project Builds successfully</p></li>
<li><p>Run StyleCop at the solution level and show that there are <strong>30 Warnings</strong> out of the box (yes, this may seem like a lot of warnings for a brand new project, with no custom code, but this was covered in later demos.  If you want more information about how this can be corrected easily, feel free to give me a shout).</p></li>
<li><p>Run StyleCop on Form1.cs and show that there are <strong>12 Warnings</strong> out of the box</p></li>
<li><p>Open StyleCop Settings and enter Copyright Information, as well as disable analysis of designer files</p></li>
<li><p>SA1633: Insert a copyright header to the top of Form1.cs using code snippet</p></li>
<li><p>Run StyleCop on Form1.cs and show that there are <strong>11 Warnings</strong> left</p></li>
<li><p>SA1600: Insert a Summary Tag (with correct text) for the Form1 constructor</p></li>
<li><p>Run StyleCop on Form1.cs and show that there are <strong>10 Warnings</strong> left</p></li>
<li><p>SA1200: Move all using statements within namespace</p></li>
<li><p>Run StyleCop on Form1.cs and show that there are <strong>2 Warnings</strong> left</p></li>
<li><p>SA1601: To show the use of a SuppressMessage, suppress this warning</p></li>
<li><p>Run StyleCop on Form1.cs and show that there are <strong>1 Warnings</strong> left</p></li>
<li><p>SA1101: Put a this. in front of the call to InitializeComponent</p></li>
<li><p>Run StyleCop on Form1.cs and show that there are <strong>0 Warnings</strong> left</p></li>
<li><p>Rejoice in the fact that StyleCop now runs with no warnings</p></li>
</ul>


<p>This was the plan, however, it turns out that this wasn’t going to be as easy as I thought!</p>

<p>When I first started creating my StyleCop Demos, and the scripts to go with it, I was using StyleCop 4.7.23 which at the time was the latest version, but unfortunately there was a bug in StyleCop surrounding SA1101.  Information on this can be found <a href="http://stylecop.codeplex.com/workitem/7266">here</a>.  What made things a little more interesting is that even though StyleCop wasn’t picking up the violation, the StyleCop for ReSharper plugin that I use was picking it up:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Problem_with_this._and_resharper.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Problem_with_this._and_resharper_thumb.png" alt="Problem_with_this._and_resharper" /></a></p>

<p>This didn’t make for a good demo, so I set about changing the script for the demo such that this bug wouldn’t be mentioned.  The morning of Saturday 26th May 2012 comes around and I am sitting in the speaker room adding the finishing touches to my slides and demos, only to find out that there is a new version of StyleCop been released, version 4.7.26.  Doing a little bit of digging, it appeared that this release fixed the issue that I was seeing, so with 1 hour before my presentation was due to start, I decided to install the latest version of StyleCop.</p>

<p>Now, I know that there are probably a lot of seasoned presenters out there that are shouting:</p>

<blockquote>WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU THINKING!!</blockquote>


<p>But, I am happy to say that the uninstall and reinstall of StyleCop went off without any problems, and on running through the script that I mentioned above, both StyleCop and StyleCop for ReSharper, correctly identify the violation:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/corrected_problem_with_this._and_resharper.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/corrected_problem_with_this._and_resharper_thumb.png" alt="corrected_problem_with_this._and_resharper" /></a></p>

<p><em>NOTE: The above screenshot is actually taken using StyleCop 4.7.27 (which was released on Tuesday 29th May 2012) and actually includes a new rule SA1126.  This appears to supersede the original violation which was SA1101.</em></p>

<p>So, long story short, if you are seeing oddities when running StyleCop, and StyleCop for ReSharper plugin, make sure that you have the most recent version of StyleCop installed.  In order to find out about new releases you can subscribe to the Release Notifications email on the CodePlex site <a href="http://stylecop.codeplex.com/releases/view/79972">here</a>.  You will need to log into CodePlex before you can enable this.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<h1>dddsw was fantastic!</h1>

<p>There is very little else to say.  The speakers were great, the venue was perfect, the food was amazing, and the geek chat wasn’t to be missed.  If you have never attended DDDSW, or for that matter one of the other DDD events around the country then you really need to think about going.  They are incredible events, and best of all, they are completely free!</p>

<p>In a slight change to the previous DDD events that I have attended, I was presenting a session this time around which meant that the stress levels were on high alert, but overall, this additional pressure didn’t detract from the day, and I had a great time!</p>

<h1>first session at dddsw</h1>

<p>Although there were a number of talks that I would have liked to have seen in this first session, I decided that I should finalize my demos and slides ahead of the second session where I would be presenting.</p>

<h1>second session at dddsw</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Gary Ewan Park (yes, me, it’s still bizarre to say this)</p>

<p><strong>Topic:</strong> StyleCop – Breaking down the barriers to entry</p>

<blockquote>Starting with a brief introduction to what StyleCop is, and what it can be used for, we will then apply StyleCop directly to a real world application.  Then we will investigate:

What breaks?
What doesn’t work?
What techniques we can use to correct StyleCop warnings/errors, and ignore them completely?
What tools can be used to speed up refactoring for StyleCop warnings/errors?</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> I leave that up to the people who attended my session, but overall, I was happy with how it all went.  There are certainly a couple of things that I would do differently if I were to do the session again (for instance, actually have my slide notes in front of me), but for a first attempt, I was very happy with it.</p>

<p>I did see one tweet that I was particularly happy with, especially since on at least a couple of occasions the demos didn’t work the way I wanted them to:</p>

<blockquote>In @[gep13](https://twitter.com/gep13) &#8216;s StyleCop session. Very fluid and polished demos and session :) [#dddsw](https://twitter.com/search/%2523dddsw)

— Phil Jones (@philjones88) [May 26, 2012](https://twitter.com/philjones88/status/206326569562669056)</blockquote>


<h1>third session at dddsw</h1>

<p><strong>Presenters:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/garyshort">Gary Short</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/plip">Phil Winstanley</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/serialseb">Seb Lambla</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/fatherfil">Phil Collins</a> and running the show <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/robertbracken">Rob Bracken</a></p>

<p><strong>Topic:</strong> Smartphone Wars (Balloon Debate)</p>

<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>This was a really entertaining debate, which saw Blackberry, iOS, Windows Phone and Android being pitted against each other.  The first casualty (being represented by Phil Collins) we Blackberry.  Closely followed by iOS which was being defended by Seb Lambla.  This left Windows Phone (supported by Phil Winstanley) and Android (with Gary Short) left.</p>

<p>As expected (given the number of .Net Developers and Windows Phone owners in the room) Windows Phone came out on top.  All joking aside though, the debate through up lots of interesting arguments about one phone OS over the other, and it left a lot of food for thought!</p>

<h1>grok talks and 20/20 sessions</h1>

<p>As now seems to be the tradition, there were Grok Talks and 20/20 presentations over lunch.  I was able to catch the last three of these, on <a href="https://github.com/slodge/MvvmCrossConference">MVVMCross</a>, <a href="http://offonourown.com/OffOnOurOwn/Welcome.html">WiFi Access Points around the world</a>, and <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/twickers/archive/2012/05/27/dddsouthwest-4.0-26th-may-2012---async-2020-presentation.aspx">async</a>.  These were all very entertaining, and my credit goes out to everyone who presented, especially the 20/20&rsquo;s, as although short, this type of talk is particularly difficult to execute!!</p>

<h1>fourth session at dddsw</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Jimmy Skowronski</p>

<p><strong>Topic: </strong>No More Passwords!</p>

<blockquote>Passwords are surrounding us, thousands of websites are asking us to register every day. At some point we tend to loose control over them and start either using the same password everywhere or escape to a password vault solutions. Many of you are building new websites almost every day and you often you need users to log in. Don&#8217;t create your own password storage in that case. Save your users from the need to create and remember yet another login and password, and use one of the existing identity providers. It can be Live ID, Facebook, Google, Twitter, Yahoo or many other and you can choose one of them or all together.

This session will show you how to get rid of your individual password storage and authenticate your user using OAuth with Live ID, Google and Facebook. You will be amazed how simple it is and your users will be amazed how cool you are.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>This was a very interesting talk!  Making use of a DLL which ships with WebMatrix, Jimmy was able to show how you can quickly enable OAuth authentication for your sites, which allows users to register using Google, Windows Live, Facebook, Twitter, etc.  Although the source code wasn’t quite ready for sharing on the day, Jimmy did mention that he will be blogging about it going forward, and if you are interested you can find the info <a href="http://jimmylarkin.net/post/2012/05/27/DDD-South-West-OAuth-Session.aspx">here</a>.</p>

<p>For his session, Jimmy tried out a new idea where he used the website that he was constructing as a replacement for a set of presentation slides.  This is a great idea, in theory, unfortunately, it didn’t really work in practice.  The choice of font, style and layout meant that unless sitting on the very first row, it was difficult to read and follow.  With a little bit of work, I could see this technique being really useful, and it certainly given a new meaning to the term dog-fooding.</p>

<h1>fifth session at dddsw</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter:</strong> Nathan Gloyn</p>

<p><strong>Topic:</strong> Is your code S.O.L.I.D?</p>

<blockquote>Everybody keeps on about SOLID principles but what are they? and why should you care?

In this session I&#8217;ll aim to walk through each principle telling you about that principle and examining why you should use it.

Once we&#8217;ve talked about the principle in theory we&#8217;ll look to how we can put it into practice refactoring an existing application.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> What can I say about this session…. Quite simply, it was the best session that I attended all day.  Nathan is a great speaker, and the demos that he provided clearly spell out each of the different principles.  With the source code downloaded, you can literally do a kDiff between the two projects to see what refactoring were put in place to implement each principle.  Huge congratulations to Nathan for a great session!!  The only thing that I would request, and this is purely selfish on my part, but I would love to see another project added which shows how you can start to include Unit Tests.  I really think that this would go a long way to closing the loop on how “best” to construct your code.</p>

<h1>missing friends</h1>

<p>Unfortunately, Craig Murphy (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/camurphy">@CAMURPHY</a>) wasn’t able to attend DDDSW.  There was speculation whether this was the first ever DDD that he has missed!!  He was there in spirit though…</p>

<p><img src="https://public.sn2.livefilestore.com/y1pKZ9x9DqjZI5nRCcTesMhloER1N3Jdty2o3cDqA32YiDq2WHKEJtkqJ64DzGPkaL0FZReSgwOAwbqvwjB-EbZzA/fa.jpg?psid=1" alt="" /></p>

<h1>sponsors and organisers</h1>

<p>A huge thank you has to go out to all the <a href="http://dddsouthwest.com/Sponsors/tabid/63/Default.aspx">sponsors</a> of DDDSW, as well as the <a href="http://dddsouthwest.com/TheTeam/tabid/68/Default.aspx">organisers</a>!  Without them this excellent event would not have happened.  Thanks!</p>

<h1>dddsw 5 in 2013</h1>

<p>The day after the event, I jokingly asked Guy Smith-Ferrier if he had already set a date for the next DDDSW, and as expected he said no.  Him and the rest of the organisers are going to take a well deserved break, however, I would definitely recommend that you keep an eye out for the next event, and if you can make it along, you won’t regret it.  I will certainly be in attendance if nothing else gets in the way!  One of the best ways to here about the event would be to follow <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/dddsouthwest">@dddsouthwest</a> on twitter.</p>

		<h1>My StyleCop Talk at DDDSW 4</h1>

<p>On Saturday 26th May 2012, I did my first ever DDD talk, entitled “StyleCop: Breaking down the barriers to entry”.  If you attended the session, and are interested in seeing either the slide deck, or the source code for the presentation, you can find the information below.  If you did attend, let me just say thank you very much, and I very much hope you enjoyed it!</p>

<h1>The Code</h1>

<p>The demonstrations that I did during the presentation, with the exception of the “real world” example, can be found on my GitHub account <a href="http://gep13.me/StyleCopDemos">here</a>.  In Demo 5b, the source code for StyleCop Contrib was a copy of the code which you can find <a href="http://stylecopcontrib.codeplex.com/">here</a>, and it was duplicated solely for demonstration purposes.</p>

<h1>The Slides</h1>

<p>A full copy of the slides that were used on the day can be found as an attachment to this post, and you can see a preview of them below:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Feedback</p>

<p>Since this was my first talk at an event the size of DDDSW, I am very anxious to get some feedback about what I did wrong, what I did right, what could be improved upon etc, so if you were at my session, and have any comments, I would be very grateful to hear them.</p>

<h1>thanks</h1>

<p>There are too many people to thank for helping to get this tour under way that I won’t be able to list them all here, but hopefully you know who you all are, and I very much appreciate all your help!!</p>

<h1>How did all this start?</h1>

<p>A few of you might be wondering how this event got started, and I thought I should take the time to explain.  First up, a HUGE shout has to go out to Gregor Suttie (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/gsuttie">@gsuttie</a>), if it were not for him, this tour would not be happening.  Let me explain…</p>

<p>Through the wonders of Twitter, I was having a conversation with Gregor, and he happened to make a throw-away comment along the lines of “…wouldn’t it be great if <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/shanselman">@shanselman</a> came to Scotland!”.  I quickly replied to him saying that yes, this would be great, but really, what are the chances.  Within a few minutes, Scott actually replied to Gregor’s tweet, asking what we were talking about.  We explained, and Scott then offered to talk the conversation offline, and provided me with his email address.  After a few emails it was clear that Scott was very interested in visiting Scotland as he has been able to trace his family tree back to Scotland, and we were only to happy to host him at our User Groups.  With some help from the <a href="http://scottishdevelopers.com/">Scottish Developer</a> guys, plans were quickly put into place to host Scott at the four venues listed above.  Thanks again Gregor!! <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" /></p>

<p>Hopefully see you all there!</p>

		<h1>DDDSW Registration is now open</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.dddsouthwest.com/"><img src="http://www.dddsouthwest.com/Portals/0/DDDSW4/DDDSouthWest4BadgeMedium.png" alt="" /></a> In case you haven’t heard, the registration for DDD South West (DDDSW) is now open.  You can find the Event Registration page <a href="http://www.dddsouthwest.com/EventRegistration/tabid/64/Default.aspx">here</a> (you will need to login/register first).</p>

<p>This is the fourth outing for this conference, and if it is anything like <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/a-review-of-dddsw-by-a-dddsw-virgin/">last year</a>, it will definitely be worth attending.  There are a couple very nice features to DDDSW which makes it very appealing.  The first is the “Getting Started&#8221; with .Net” track.  If you are new to .Net, then this is the perfect place to get started.  And the second if the “Repeat” track.  Once all the speakers are confirmed, voting opens on the most popular talks, and they are scheduled to be shown at another time during the day.  This is a great help, as there are normally always two things on at the same time, and with this approach, it means that you will hopefully be able to see both.  For the full agenda, take a look <a href="http://www.dddsouthwest.com/Agenda/tabid/55/Default.aspx">here</a>.</p>

<h1>I am doing a talk</h1>

<p>One surprising (at least to me) twist to the story of DDDSW is that I am going to be doing a session!  I have been debating for a long time now about whether I should submit a session to a DDD event.  With a little gentle nudging from Guy Smith-Ferrier, I decided to take the plunge.  The sessions that I submitted can be seen <a href="http://www.dddsouthwest.com/ProposedSessions/tabid/69/Default.aspx">here</a>.  The one that actually got picked is “<strong>StyleCop – Breaking down the barriers to entry”.</strong>  The abstract for this talk is:</p>

<blockquote>Starting with a brief introduction to what StyleCop is, and what it can be used for, we will then apply StyleCop directly to a real world application.  Then we will investigate:

> 
> 
    
>   * What breaks?
> 
    
>   * What doesn’t work?
> 
    
>   * What techniques we can use to correct StyleCop warnings/errors, and ignore them completely?
> 
    
>   * What tools can be used to speed up refactoring for StyleCop warnings/errors?
> 

</blockquote>


<p>I have done this talk before at the <a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/">Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group</a>, and I am looking forward to doing it again, there have been a couple releases of StyleCop since I did the talk, and a couple extra features have made their way into the product.</p>

<h1>Mobile application</h1>

<p>Last year at DDDSW there was a Windows Phone 7 Application (you can see it <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/almost-time-for-dddsw/">here</a>) that proved to be very helpful on the day for looking up session information.  The Mobile Application(s) for DDDSW 4 haven’t been released yet, but I have it on good authority that they are in the works, so I would advice you to keep an eye out for them.  I will update this post once I know exactly where it is, and how you can get your hands on it.</p>

<h1>Helping out</h1>

<p>In the same way as last year, I have volunteered to help out at this years DDDSW.  Since I am going to be doing a talk, I don’t know exactly what this will mean, as I might not be in the right frame of mind to help out (depending on how many boo’s from the crowd I get) but I am sure that Guy Smith-Ferrier (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/GuySmithFerrier">@GuySmithFerrier</a>) will keep me right.</p>

<h1>First Morning Session at DevWeek Day 3</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Richard Blewett (you can find him on twitter <a href="http://www.dotnetconsult.co.uk/weblog2/">@richardblewett</a> and his <a href="http://www.dotnetconsult.co.uk/weblog2/">blog</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Topic: </strong>What’s new in WCF 4.5</p>

<blockquote>The WCF team has been busy. WCF 4.5 comes with a host of new features: further configuration simplifications, WebSockets support, contract first development and more. This session shows you the new features, explains why they were introduced, and examines what impact they will have on the way you build distributed systems.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>I know a lot of people slate WCF, and haven’t got anything good to say about it, but my experience has been that it works for what it was intended, and we have used it with a lot of success in-house.  I was very keen to see what features were coming in 4.5, and I wasn’t disappointed.  Richard was able to fully explain the up and coming features, even though he did have some issues with his Windows 8 Virtual Machine and Virtual Box near the start of the session.  If you are interested in seeing what it on offer, I would highly recommend taking a look at the slides for this session when they are made available on the DevWeek website.  One of the many interesting features that comes with this release is the ability to implement UDP and a true “fire and forget” broadcast of messages, which as demonstrated in the session is quicker than standard TCP (assuming of course that you are able to handle the potential for missed packets).</p>

<h1>Second Morning Session at DevWeek Day 3</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Jeff Prosise (you can find him on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jprosise">@jprosise</a> and his <a href="http://www.wintellect.com/cs/blogs/jprosise/">blog</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Topic: </strong>Building cross-platform mobile applications with HTML5 and PhoneGap</p>

<blockquote>Windows Phone 7 is a great platform, but the greatest challenge facing mobile developers today is writing apps that run on all the popular mobile platforms. With HTML5 and PhoneGap, you can write apps that exploit native features of the operating system and run on a wide range of devices. And the recently released PhoneGap 1.3 makes Windows Phone 7 a first-class citizen in the PhoneGap environment. Join the fun as Jeff explores the world of cross-platform mobile development and demonstrates the pros and cons of going HTML5 versus going native.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>Although I had attended Jeff’s full day session on HTML5, I was so impressed with him as a speaker that I decided to check out this session as well.  Once again, Jeff simply told you straight what was good and what wasn’t.  Although the idea of developing once and deploying everywhere is an appealing thought, in practice, the result is not always perfect.  The examples that Jeff showed where he made use of the device accelerometer, and also populating a ListBox full of contacts showed that the performance of the resulting application was not up to scratch.  Although it was “ok” it isn’t really something that you would like to put into the hands of a customer.  Now, admittedly, some of the performance issues were down to the browser on the phone, for instance the handling of CSS in Internet Explorer on the Windows Phone 7 device, however, most of the issues are down to the interfacing between JavaScript and the native phone functions.  This is likely something that will improve over time, and the ideal that is develop once and deploy everywhere may become a true option.  For now, depending on the type of application that you are creating, using a technology such as PhoneGap won’t cut it, however, it is a technology that I will be keeping an eye on.  Another great session from Jeff, thanks!</p>

<h1>First Afternoon Session at DevWeek Day 3</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Matt Milner (you can find him on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/milnertweet">@milnertweet</a> and his <a href="http://mattmilner.com/blog/">blog</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Topic: </strong>OData everywhere!</p>

<blockquote>More and more servers and systems are providing access to their data via OData, the open standard protocol for data exchange on the internet. In this session learn how to use your .NET skills to publish and consume that data from a variety of clients. We will start by showing the very elegant .NET client solution for OData services, and quickly move into the different libraries available for each client platform to understand the unique features and constraints of each.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>DevWeek really has been full of great sessions, and this one was no different.  Matt is a great speaker, and it is easy to see why Pluralsight have picked him up as an author for their videos.  This time the topic was OData, again, another technology that we make use of from time to time.  The big selling point of OData is that once you have used it in one place, the interface and integration of it in another system, is very similar.  Granted, the data that is being exposed is going to change, but the way in which it is accessed is exactly the same, so you don’t have to worry about re-learning another system, each time you want to use it.  The new tooling support that comes in .NET 4.5 and Visual Studio 11 extends the already existing functionality to make working with OData trivial, both on the server and on the client.  There were a lot of take away points from this session for me, not least the tooling the is available on the OData Eco System to make working with OData that bit easier.</p>

<h1>Second Afternoon Session at DevWeek Day 3</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Christian Weyer (you can find him on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/christianweyer">@christianweyer</a> and his <a href="http://weblogs.thinktecture.com/cweyer/">blog</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Topic: </strong>Real-world experience with Windows Azure</p>

<blockquote>No doubt: cloud computing is here. And we as .NET-branded developers can participate in the big game with the Windows Azure platform. In this session Christian reports first experiences from real world projects and demonstrates a couple of lessons-learned and various good practices. A number of things are very different when you are running on a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) like Windows Azure and the earlier you know and think about them the better it will be for your eventual cloud success. Come and hear about Azure-related topics like cost-oriented architecture, development & deployment, diagnostics & monitoring, optimisation or handling databases</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>Wow!  Just wow!  Hands down, I think that this was the most enjoyable session that I went to at DevWeek.  I have to say a big congratulations to Christian, he is very good at what he does, and like some of the other presenters at DevWeek he simply don’t it like it is, which is something that I really enjoyed about DevWeek.  On his opening slide, Christian had two sections, “What to expect” and “What not to expect”, one of which was “No Marketing FUD!”</p>

<p>Having looked at Windows Azure for a while now, but never actually getting a chance to use it in anger, I was very curious to hear about how Windows Azure had been used in the wild, and Christian was very much able to deliver on this.  He had a number of real life applications, some of which he was even able to show us running live in the cloud.  He was even able to deal with what were probably my annoying questions from the back of the room, and I can honestly say that I got a huge amount of information from this session, thank you very much!</p>

<p>Two stand out items from this talk, for me, were the correct pronunciation of the word “Azure” (he had a WAV file that explained exactly how to say it) and also an explanation of what the word Azure actually means.  If you are unsure, take a look at the Wikipedia article for Azure, specifically about how it relates to clouds <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/wlEmoticon-smile1.png" alt="Smile" />.</p>

<p>However, hands down, the most interesting demonstration was the ability to push a zip file, which contains an entire website into Blob Storage, and then have a background task running on a Web Role pick this up, and deploy it into IIS and start-up the site.  This was an amazing demonstration! Simply put, a lot of people complain about the start-up time of a Windows Azure deployment, but this demonstration showed an entire web site being deployed within a minute!  Although this is custom code running in his Cloud instance, Christian did hint at the fact that functionality such as this may well be making it into an Azure Platform near you in 2012.  Exciting times!</p>

<h1>First Morning Session at DevWeek Day 2</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Mike Taulty (you can find him on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/mtaulty">@mtaulty</a> and his <a href="http://mtaulty.com/communityserver/blogs/mike_taultys_blog/default.aspx">blog</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Topic: </strong>Technical Keynote – Windows 8 for application developers</p>

<blockquote>Windows 8 is Windows re-imagined for new devices, form-factors and chipsets embracing and unifying touch as a first-class input mechanism and providing a new platform for fast and fluid Metro style applications that put the application and the user front and centre. Developing Metro style applications involves a new set of tooling in Visual Studio and new versions of Expression Blend where you can author your UI in HTML or XAML and write your logic in JavaScript, C# or C++. The new WinRT runtime provides APIs that expose platform capabilities like storage, networking, media and also provides access to the contracts that let Windows loosely link your applications with others on the user’s machine.
This session will set the scene for the Windows 8 operating system and Windows 8 “Metro Style” applications, and the huge opportunity that they offer you as an application developer.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>For a lot of reasons, I have not been in a position to play with either Windows 8 or Visual Studio 11.  I have both of the Developer previews downloaded but I haven’t installed them.  As a result, it was great to see both of these items being used in anger, and Mike Taulty provided a very good overview of how the twos things can be used together.</p>

<p>There were a couple of times when the demonstration didn’t go quite the way that I think Mike wanted it to, but if this in any way flustered him, it wasn’t obvious.  The problems that did crop up were nothing major and to be expected with running a Consumer Technical Preview on a prototype device.</p>

<p>Of particular interest was seeing how .NET assemblies could be created and consumed within a Metro Application using HTML5 and JavaScript.  This did involve jumping through a few hoops by first converting the Project Type to use WinMD, and also meant creating a “copy” of the returned object since it couldn’t be used directly.  All in all though, it was a very impressive demonstration of what could be done.</p>

<p>A couple interesting links that came out of the session:</p>

<h1>Second Morning Session at DevWeek Day 2</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Dino Esposito (you can find him on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/despos">@despos</a> and his <a href="http://www.expoware.org/">site</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Topic: </strong>ASP.NET MVC: Programming for the real world</p>

<blockquote>You cannot realistically write an ASP.NET MVC controller class without making extensive use of action filters. In ASP.NET MVC, an action filter affects the way in which controller methods execute. An action filter can be used to trap exceptions, authorise access, cache output, and validate requests. This is only the first stage of flexibility, however. In this session, we’ll first see how to create custom filters to perform a variety of custom tasks including compressing the response, adapting to the browser, filling up view dependencies. Up to here, however, filters are only attached to methods statically. The next step consists of defining an infrastructure for you to load filters dynamically thus gaining the ability to toggle certain behaviour on or off on the fly.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>Having read the description for this session, I was very much looking forward to it.  I have never seen a presentation from Dino before, but it has to be said that he is a very good presenter!  He is obviously very passionate about the topic, and you can’t help but get swept up in his enthusiasm!</p>

<p>The main topic of this presentation was the use of Action Filters, and how these can be used to make your code more readable (the main point that Dino was trying to push throughout the session).</p>

<p>It was very interesting to see how an Action Filter can be used to intercept:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The start of the request</p></li>
<li><p>The end of the request</p></li>
<li><p>The start of the response</p></li>
<li><p>The end of the response</p></li>
</ul>


<p>and how code could be applied at any of these points.  One of the examples that was shown was the inclusion of logging to record how long the request took to execute.  Very interesting.</p>

<p>Dino then went on to show how the necessary Action Filter Attributes out of the code file into the configuration file, and then injected into the code.  The only problem that I had with this is that it potentially made the code “less” readable.  Without looking at the configuration file, in conjunction with the source code, there was no way to see which Action Filters were being applied where.</p>

<h1>First Afternoon Session at DevWeek Day 2</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Robert Boedigheimer (you can find him on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/boedie">@boedie</a> and his <a href="http://aspadvice.com/blogs/robertb">blog</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Topic: </strong>ASP.NET and Visual Studio 11</p>

<blockquote>Learn about the great new features coming in the next version of ASP.NET and Visual Studio. There are some great enhancements to all of the editors (CSS snippets, CSS vendor prefixes, JavaScript go to definition, etc). Discover the new model binding and repository capabilities in Web Forms, along with unobtrusive jQuery validation support for validators. See how to bundle and minify CSS and JavaScript files simply to drastically improve web site performance. A new script manager also supports debug, release, and CDN versions of files</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>As mentioned above, I haven’t played with Visual Studio 11, so I was very interested to see the changes that were coming in it.  The fact that the session was going to be focused on ASP.NET was a bit of a bonus!</p>

<p>Bottom line, ignoring all the arguments about the colour and icons and whether this is good or bad, the new Visual Studio has some very interesting features!  Some of the stand out items for me included:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Image Thumbnails in the Solution Explorer – very cool!</p></li>
<li><p>The new Preview Tab which brings up the file with a single click in the Solution Explorer</p></li>
<li><p>Matching tag renaming in the Source Editor</p></li>
<li><p>Attribute Code Intellisense</p></li>
<li><p>New Page Inspector which combines F12 Developer Tools type functionality directly in Visual Studio</p></li>
<li><p>Built in minification of CSS and JavaScript files, including ability to provide a hash code to the resulting bundle to ensure re-download when changes occur on the server</p></li>
<li><p>Support for HTML 5 Types from the TextBox Server Control</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Overall, I really enjoyed this session, not least because Robert is a very good speaker, there are a lot of great features going in this next release of Visual Studio and I am very much looking forward to starting to use it.  The fact that you can “round trip” projects between Visual Studio 11 and Visual Studio 2010 (assuming you don’t use any new features in .NET 4.5) will make the transition to this use IDE much easier!</p>

<h1>Second Afternoon Session at DevWeek Day 2</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Dave Wheeler (you can find him on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/coloringinguy">@coloringinguy</a> and his <a href="http://coloringinguy.com/">blog</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Topic: </strong>A .NET developer’s guide to WinRT</p>

<blockquote>Come to this session to find out how to consume and interact with WinRT from managed code.
Learn how to write WinRT components; how to integrate them with C++ and JavaScript code; and just how natural and fluid it is to work with WinRT from managed code.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>Having listened to Mike Taulty’s keynote speech around Metro and WinRT, I was hoping to get some more information regarding the innards of developing with it in this session, and I wasn’t disappointed.  Dave did a great job of cutting through some the marketing regarding Metro and WinRT and basically told it how it is.  This is not to say that he slated Metro or WinRT in any way, that certainly wasn’t the case, but rather, simply told it how it is.</p>

<p>He made is clear that much like it was with Silverlight Development, certain things will not be available when doing Metro Development.  This is due to the new .Net Core Profile.  For instance, although you will be able to use LINQ to Objects, there is no LINQ to SQL, or LINQ to Entities.  This is mainly due to the fact that there is no support for ADO.NET in WinRT.</p>

<p>As with the other talks today, this one was also very good, and it ended a very enjoyable first day of sessions at DevWeek.</p>

		<p>What follows is a brief summary of the final day of <a href="http://www.devweek.com/">DevWeek 2012</a>.  It has been a very long, but also a very enjoyable, week and I have to give a lot of credit of all of the organisers, speakers and sponsors for putting on a great conference.  Congratulations to Nick Payne of <a href="http://www.bearpark.co.uk/">Bearkpark Publishing</a> for organising everything!  Reviews of the other days of DevWeek can be seen here:</p>

<h1>Post-Conference Workshop at DevWeek</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter:</strong> Kevin Jones (you can find him on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/kevinrjones">@kevinrjones</a> and his <a href="http://www.rocksolidknowledge.com/">site</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Topic:</strong> A day of unit testing</p>

<blockquote>Unit testing has become more prevalent over the last few years as more and more teams have come to realise the importance of ensuring code has some degree of test coverage. Developers are aware that code quality is an important issue and that to get high quality code they often need to refactor. Refactoring safely requires unit tests. We will spend the day looking at unit testing, how to write a unit test, how to test external resources such as databases and web services, how to work with legacy code and how to ensure that your code is designed to be tested.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> I actually got a lot from this session.  Not only is Kevin a great speaker, but he was able to provide lots of real life experiences with regard to how he has used Unit Testing in the various jobs that he has had.  I have done a lot of reading on the subject of Unit Testing but for one reason or another have not been able to fully implement at my place of work the way that I would like to.  What I particularly liked about this session was the pragmatic approach that Kevin used to implementing Unit Testing.</p>

<p>In this day long session, Kevin talked through lots of topics that you would expect in a session like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Unit Testing</p></li>
<li><p>Integration Testing</p></li>
<li><p>Mocking</p></li>
<li><p>Dependency Injection</p></li>
<li><p>Inversion of Control</p></li>
</ul>


<p>However, what was really impressive about this session was the final demonstration which brought everything together into one concrete demonstration application.  This included:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Starting with a blank ASP.NET MVC Application which would use Unity</p></li>
<li><p>Adding a new Integration Test Project and added Specflow, Selenium and NUnit</p></li>
<li><p>Adding a new Unit Test Project and added NUnit</p></li>
<li><p>Created a Specflow Feature and Scenario and saw it fail</p></li>
<li><p>Created some Unit Tests and saw them fail</p></li>
<li><p>Implemented the necessary code, i.e. Controller and View to make the tests pass</p></li>
<li><p>Refactored the code to include repository pattern for Database access using Entity Framework and Unity for injecting a repository instance whilst ensuring Tests continued to pass, as well as mocking the repository for testing purposes</p></li>
</ul>


<p>All in all, this single demonstration brought everything together for me, and it really hammered home all the topics of the day.  Very well done!!</p>

<p>In addition, Kevin is also working on a blog application which demonstrates the use of all of these frameworks and strategies.  You can find this on his GiHub account <a href="https://github.com/kevinrjones/mblog">here</a>.  Bear in mind, this application has been created in Visual Studio 11 using .NET Framework 4.5 and the Beta edition of Entity Framework 5, so if you want to play with it, you will need to have all of these installed somewhere.</p>

<p>Thanks for a great session Kevin!!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>This morning I found another notification to indicate that there was an update for my Windows Phone 7, Nokia Lumia 800 Handset.  Given the <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/nokia-lumia-800-to-get-tethering-support-soon/">recent announcement</a>, I hurriedly set about getting the update installed.</p>

<p>In the style of my previous Windows Phone 7 update posts, here are some of the screenshots that I took along the update process:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/2012-03-30_0801.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/2012-03-30_0801_thumb.png" alt="Update for Windows Phone 7 Available" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/2012-03-30_0806.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/2012-03-30_0806_thumb.png" alt="Update Your Phone in Zune" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/2012-03-30_0824.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/2012-03-30_0824_thumb.png" alt="Update of Windows Phone 7 Complete" /></a></p>

<p>As soon as the update was completed, and the Windows Phone 7 handset had rebooted, I straight away went into the Settings menu where I was sure that I was going to find the <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/update-7-10-7710-68-for-windows-phone-7-wp7/">Internet Sharing</a> option, but unfortunately, it is still not there!</p>

<p>On doing some searching, I turned up this <a href="http://discussions.europe.nokia.com/t5/Nokia-with-Windows-Phone/Heads-up-on-Lumia-800-update-1600-2487-8107-12070/td-p/1361057">Nokia Support Discussion</a> which explains that this update does:</p>

<blockquote>

> 
> 
    
>   * brings significant improvements in battery performance, especially in 3G talk time as well as in predictive usage time, standby time, WiFi browsing time and music playback time.
> 
    
>   * Improved bass in audio performance
> 
    
>   * The back, start, and search keys are lit according to screen brightness settings
> 
    
>   * Fix to prevent rebooting in certain network conditions
> 
    
>   * Fix for call hang up issues in certain markets
> 

</blockquote>


<p>These things are all great, and I had actually noticed the rebooting of the phone when starting up initially, so I am glad that this is fixed, however, I still REALLY want to be able to tether my laptop to my Windows Phone 7.</p>

<p>Hopefully the next update from Nokia for the Windows Phone 7 will include this functionality, and further, I hope that my current mobile operator supports this function (which I have been told that they do).</p>

<p>For those interested in version numbers etc, this update took my Windows Phone 7 from:</p>

<p>Firmware Revision Number: <strong>1600.2483.8106.11500 </strong>to <strong>1600.2487.8107.12070</strong></p>
