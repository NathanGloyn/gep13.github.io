	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Since setting up my personal Twitter account and an account for Aberdeen Developers, I have been playing with an application called TweetDeck, available <a href="http://www.tweetdeck.com/beta/">here</a>.</p>

<p>I have set it up so that it has both these Twitter accounts, as well as my Facebook and LinkedIn accounts. There is also the option of adding a Foursqaure account, a Google Buzz account and a MySpace account, none of which I have. But now the question, do I need one….</p>

<p>Has social networking got to the point that there are now just too many separate accounts in order to be useful, and what’s needed is a third party application, such as TweetDeck, which by the way I had to set up an account for, in order to stitch them altogether?</p>

		<p>I am happy to inform you that I have been able to confirm another meeting on the 23rd September. Colin Mackay, of Scottish Developers will be doing a talk on SQL Injection, and how to prevent it. Full details of the event can be found here:</p>

<p>I am also currently working on getting another meeting lined up for October/November. Still need to confirm a few details, so I won’t say too much just yet, but it is likely to be an ASP.Net talk. If there is something specific in this area that you would like to hear a talk on, then let me know, and I will see what I can do.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I have just discovered the Windows Live Writer package which is distributed as one of the Windows Live Essentials packages, along with:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Photo Gallery</p></li>
<li><p>Movie Maker</p></li>
<li><p>Mail</p></li>
<li><p>Messenger</p></li>
<li><p>Family Safety</p></li>
<li><p>Toolbar</p></li>
</ul>


<p>You can find more information about it <a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-writer">here</a> and Windows Live Essentials <a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-essentials?os=other">here</a>.</p>

<p>So far, I have been very impressed with it, and am using it both on this blog, which uses a customized Community Server blog engine, and at work which has a SharePoint blog, both on which work great.</p>

<p>Live Writer downloads the theme associated with your blog post, including colour, widths, fonts etc, so you get a real time look of how your blog will look before you post it.</p>

<p>There are a number of Plug-in’s that you can use with Live Writer, far too many to talk about here, but so far I am using a Code Highligther Plug-in which automatically converts C# or VB.net code into HTML and a Twitter Plug-in, which automatically creates a tweet when I create a blog post.</p>

<p>This scheme is set to end on the 30th June, so you will have to act fast.</p>

<p>I have always wanted a German Shepherd, ever since I was little, so you better believe I will be offering to dog-sit.</p>

<p>We went round to visit her tonight, and she is very cute!!!</p>

<p>UPDATE: My sister and her partner actually now have a second dog.  She is called Kiwi, and she is a Black Labrador.  You can see some photos of her below:</p>

		<p>Last night was the Matrikon Christmas Party, and it was at the Ardoe House Hotel. We had 7 tables, and there were a number of other companies there as well, so it was a good atmosphere.</p>

<p>I thought the meal was very good, but I heard some people that they didn&rsquo;t like it very much, “turkey was too dry”, “dessert was disgusting”, etc., but I really liked it.</p>

<p>Wes took the role of Paparazzi for the evening, so I am hoping that he has got some good shots. I will try and get the photos from him and put them up on the website.</p>

<p>The night ended with the obligatory rendition was Runrig&rsquo;s Loch Lomond, which was a lot of fun, and then it was home to bed.</p>

<p>The photos from the night can be seen here:</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>This weekend was my birthday, and Lynn and myself spent the weekend together with a number of different activities.</p>

<p>The first was Clubland on Friday night at the Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Centre. To say I felt a little bit old at the event would be a little bit of an understatement. The event was full of lot of young people wearing very little clothes!!! I think there is going to be a major flu epidemic hitting Aberdeen in the next few days. Have to say though, I had quite a good time, didn&rsquo;t know many of the songs, or the artists, but it was good. You can see the pictures below:</p>

<p>[nggallery id=28]</p>

<p>We then went down to Glasgow to spend the weekend. We took the Mega Bus down rather than the train this time, but that was fine. We stayed in the same Holiday Inn by Express that we stayed in last time. Once we arrived we went for a meal at Di Maggio&rsquo;s, it was really nice!!! Then we took a taxi to The Saw Doctors concert at The Barrow Lands. I had a really good time, they put on a really good show!! I picked up a new t-shirt and the new CD, which I am looking forward to listening too. You can see the photos from the concert below:</p>

<p>[nggallery id=29]</p>

<p>Sunday was spent doing some shopping, and then we went to see the new Angelina Jolie film, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0824747/">Changeling</a>. It was quite a sad story, but it was a really good watch.</p>

<p>In the evening we went to the <a href="http://www.jongleurs.com/">Jongleurs</a> comedy club. We got a table for two right at the front of the stage, we were a little concerned that we were going to get picked on, but we didn&rsquo;t. The three comics that were there were very funny, and I would fully recommend going along. There was one annoying girl in the crowd who thought she was funny, and was continually trying to heckle the comics, but she ended up coming across very annoying!! Towards the end I think she got the idea, and stopped heckling.</p>

<p>We came back up the road on the Mega Bus again on Monday afternoon, after having a great weekend.</p>

		<p>Lynn and I met up with folks and my sister and her boyfriend and his son for a meal this afternoon at the Mill of Mundurno and it was really nice!!!</p>

<p>The food was really nice, and the place looks like it has just been done up, so I would definitely recommend it!!</p>

<p>Couldn&rsquo;t decide what I was going to have, but ended up choosing the Steak Pie (substituting the Mash and Peas for Chips and Beans) and it was lovely. For dessert you were able to choose a small portion of three different desserts, so thought I would go for that. Made two very good choices, the Belgian Waffles and the Cheesecake, but the bitter chocolate pudding definitely wasn&rsquo;t to my taste.</p>
