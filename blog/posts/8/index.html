	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Today was the first day of <a href="http://www.devweek.com/">DevWeek 2012</a>, and I am happy to say that I have had a great day!  I have never been to DevWeek before, and the format of it is slightly different from other developer events that I have attended.   I am lucky enough to be attending the whole week of events at DevWeek, and today there was a choice of 9 different sessions.  These ranged from “A Day of Metro” to “Agile Primer”.  Reviews of the other days of DevWeek can be seen here:</p>

<ul>

<li><p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/review-of-day-5-of-devweek/">Day 5 - Post-Conference Workshops</a></p></li>
</ul>


<h1>Pre-Conference Workshop at DevWeek</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Jeff Prosise (you can find his blog <a href="http://www.wintellect.com/cs/blogs/jprosise/">here</a> and his twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jprosise">here</a>:</p>

<p><strong>Topic: </strong>HTML5 Workshop</p>

<blockquote>HTML 5 is the newest version of HTML, and it is taking the programming world by storm. It combines new markup elements with a host of new JavaScript APIs to bring HTML into the 21st century and to enable developers to build rich, feature-filled Web applications without relying on browser plug-ins such as Silverlight and Flash.
In this full-day pre-conference tutorial, we’ll take a deep dive into HTML 5 and show all the bells and whistles, including new markup elements, browser support, audio and video, the canvas API, local storage, web workers, geolocation, and much, much more.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> In house, we are heavily invested in Silverlight, however, HTML 5, although still not officially a standard, and yet to be fully implemented in browsers, is certainly making waves, and I was very interested to hear about what it is, what it does, and what actually works.  The day long workshop was broken up into the following sections:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Introduction</p></li>
<li><p>Geolocation</p></li>
<li><p>Audio and Video</p></li>
<li><p>Canvas</p></li>
<li><p>Web Workers</p></li>
<li><p>Web Storage</p></li>
<li><p>Files</p></li>
<li><p>Drag and Drop</p></li>
<li><p>Networking</p></li>
</ul>


<p>With each section, Jeff had a number of very good demonstrations with he was able to show working (in some cases this meant switching between different browsers), and this really helped to concrete the topics that were being explained.</p>

<p>If you are interested in seeing the demo code, it is available for download <a href="http://wintellect.com/downloads/html5.zip">here</a>.  As a suggestion to Jeff, if he is reading, I think it would be great if these samples were to make them onto something like GitHub.  With the rate at which the HTML 5 specification is evolving, along with changes to browsers implementations, having the code in GitHub would allow it to be easier maintained and updated.  Just an idea.</p>

<p>One thing that I really enjoyed about todays workshops were the synergies that Jeff was able to bring to the table.  With a background in Silverlight, Jeff was able to give honest opinions about how things differed between the two technologies.  Both the good and the bad.  This really helped!!  I think the important thing is going to be knowing when to use HTML 5.  In some places it is going to make sense to use it, in others, continuing to use Silverlight (which is due to be supported for the next 10 years) is still going to make sense.</p>

<p>All in all, Jeff was a great speaker, and I really enjoyed this day long introduction to HTML 5.  I am very much looking forward to the rest of the week, and looking ahead at the sessions available Jeff has a number of other sessions which I am now thinking about attending.  The problem here being that there are SO many good sessions on offer, than choosing between them is going to be very hard!  For the Post Conference Workshop I am signed up for “A day of unit testing” with Kevin Jones, which I think will be a really useful day!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I have just found out that the much-needed internet tethering feature for my Nokia Lumia 800 is coming, it just hasn’t been announced when it will be arriving.  The only hint that we get is via an online <a href="http://nokiaconnects.com/2012/03/13/nokia-lumia-900-your-questions-answered/">Q&amp;A blog post on the Nokia Connects site</a>, which states:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/image.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/image_thumb.png" alt="Nokia Lumia 800 to get tethering support" /></a></p>

<p>This really is great news, and although it has not been confirmed when this update will be shipped, the confirmation that this feature is actually coming to the Nokia Lumia 800 is in itself huge news.</p>

<p>I have recently moved mobile phone operator specifically for the reason that I wanted an unlimited data contract, and the fact that the Nokia Lumia 800 couldn’t tether is a real pain as it means I have to switch SIM between my HTC HD7 which does have the feature.  I personally can’t wait for this update to be released!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Back in June 2011, I asked an <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/can-net-user-groups-get-office365-for-free/">open question</a> to the community regarding Office 365.  The question was simple….</p>

<blockquote>Can .Net User Groups get Office 365 for free?</blockquote>


<p>To me, it seemed like a simple enough question, however, at the time, it seemed that there was no simple answer.  Once the Office 365 Beta that I was using for managing the <a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/">Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group</a> email expired, I transitioned to using a paid P1 plan.  This was for a number of reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> The Office 365 Service is very good!  It does exactly what it says on the tin, and I had already done the hard work of setting up the domain, and getting it all working.</p></li>
<li><p> As I mentioned in my earlier blog post, it is not a huge amount of money for the service, so I was happy to pay for it.  The only slight problem being that other members of the User Group simply use email aliases, rather than having a full-blown mailbox, as we couldn’t warrant paying for an account for everyone.</p></li>
<li><p> There was still no confirmation on whether we could, or could not get it for free.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>However, thanks to an email from Andrew Westgarth (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/apwestgarth">@apwestgarth</a>), I am happy to be able to let you know that through <a href="https://www.technicalcommunity.com/Pages/default.aspx">UGSS</a> (User Group Support Services), it is now possible to get an E3 Office 365 Plan for your User Group.  Full details of the offer can be found here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.microsofttraining.com/office365/">http://www.microsofttraining.com/office365/</a></p>

<p>I have just started the registration process, so I haven’t got this all setup yet, but if I run into any problems, I will let you know.  I am hoping that there isn’t going to be a problem with already having a paid Office 365 Plan, as the registration instructions mention starting a trial Office 365 Plan, but we will wait and see.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I woke up this morning to find that my shiny new Windows Phone 7, the Nokia Lumia 800, was telling me that I had a new update.</p>

<p>As some of you will know, I REALLY like the Nokia Lumia 800, it is a great piece of hardware, but it has one killer feature missing, in my opinion.  This is the ability to tether the phone to my laptop using “Internet Sharing” as I could on my HTC HD7.</p>

<p>I have heard from both parties in this problem, i.e. Nokia and my mobile phone provider, and both say that it “should” work, but alas, it doesn’t.  I was sort of hoping that this new update would bring with it the ability to tether, but alas, it didn’t <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/wlEmoticon-sadsmile.png" alt="Sad smile" />.</p>

<p>In the style of my previous Windows Phone 7 update posts, here is the screen shot that greets you when you start to do this update:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Firmware_Update.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Firmware_Update_thumb.png" alt="Firmware_Update" /></a></p>

<p>This update took my Windows Phone 7 from:</p>

<p>Firmware Revision Number: <strong>1600.2479.7740.11451 </strong>to <strong>1600.2483.8106.11500</strong></p>

<p>Details of what is included in this particular update can be found <a href="http://conversations.nokia.com/2012/01/18/new-software-update-for-the-nokia-lumia-800/">here</a>.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Tonight I started to configure my new Windows Phone 7, the <a href="http://www.nokia.com/gb-en/products/phone/lumia800/">Nokia Lumia 800</a>.  I was lucky enough to receive this phone when I attended the <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/windows-phone-7-bootcamp-uk-tech-days/">Windows Phone 7 Bootcamp</a> in London, which was part of UK Tech Days, which is organised and run by Microsoft.</p>

<p>While doing this, I got a distinct feeling of <em>deja vu</em>, as I recently applied this <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/update-7-10-8107-79-for-windows-phone-7-wp7/">update for my HTC HD7</a>.</p>

<p>In the same way as the last time, the update itself went in without any problems.  One interesting difference between the two updates can be seen in the following screenshot though:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/2012-02-08_2014.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/2012-02-08_2014_thumb.png" alt="2012-02-08_2014" /></a></p>

<p>If you compare this to the previous screenshot, you will see that there is no mention of the “<em>HTC Update for Windows Phone”</em> which was present on the last update screen.</p>

<p>I had heard that mobile phone operators were pushing out their own updates, in this case HTC, but I have never seen it first hand.  It was also my understanding that mobile operators would come out with their own updates, not bundled with an Operating System update, but it appears that this also isn’t the case.</p>

<p>I would have also thought that in this case, the build number would also be different, in order to show what is, and what isn’t installed on a particular handset.  Quite why this hasn’t been done, I am not sure.  Perhaps this is what is included in the firmware version number for the handset.</p>

<p>I am now going through the process of re-installing the applications that I have on my HD7, onto my Lumia.  I asked the question while I was at the Bootcamp whether there was anyway to automate this process, but the answer was no.</p>

<p>One annoyance that I have found with the Nokia Lumia 800 is that at the minute, even after applying the latest update, the Internet Sharing function for the phone is not available.  Any noted <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/update-7-10-7710-68-for-windows-phone-7-wp7/">here</a> this is a fundamental feature on my current handset, and I am going to miss having it.  While I was at the Bootcamp I specifically asked the Nokia representative whether this feature was going to be available on the Lumia, and I was told that it would. be, assuming that the Mobile Operator enabled it.  However, after talking directly to 3 this afternoon, they are saying that it is Nokia that need to first enable this feature.</p>

<p>Having done some googling, it is not clear to me at this point who is right and who is wrong.  Even on Nokia’s own support forum there are <a href="http://discussions.europe.nokia.com/t5/Nokia-with-Windows-Phone/Internet-sharing-teathering-on-Lumia-800/td-p/1285135">mixed comments</a>.  I have seen references to an update being provided in early 2012, specifically from <a href="http://www.windowsphonedaily.com/2011/12/nokia-italy-internet-sharing-coming-to.html">Nokia Italy</a>.  Hopefully some more concrete news fill be released soon.</p>

		<p>Hot on the heels of the <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/windows-azure-bootcamp-uk-tech-days/">Windows Azure Bootcamp</a> that I did this weekend, I decided that I wanted to do <em>something</em> with Windows Azure, that way I could practice what I had learnt, and begin to increase my exposure to what Windows Azure brings to the table. I decided that I wanted to use the Windows Azure Blob Storage to host all of the static content of my WordPress Blog, thus, <em>hopefully, </em>increasing the performance of my blog. What follows is a list of instructions for setting up your WordPress Blog, as well as your Windows Azure account, and also your domain registrar (in order to apply a shortened domain name to your Blob Storage Account).</p>

<p>This article breaks down into three main parts:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Set up your Blob Storage Account in the Windows Azure Portal, along with DNS settings for your Domain Registrar</p></li>
<li><p> Configure your Blob Storage Account using CloudXplorer</p></li>
<li><p> Set up a WordPress plugin to communicate with your Blob Storage Account</p></li>
</ol>


<p>So, let&rsquo;s get started!</p>

<h1>Setting up Windows Azure</h1>

<ol>
<li><p> The first thing that you are going to need is a Windows Azure Account. If you don’t already have one, there are a couple of ways that you can get one:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/">Windows Azure 3 Month Free Trial</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits/">MSDN Subscribers can get Free Benefits</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/">A number of different paid subscriptions</a></p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p> Once you have logged into your Windows Azure account, you will be presented with a huge selection of options, the scope of which are far out with the intention of this blog post, as a result, only the specific options to enable Blob Storage will be discussed here. Using the picture to the below as a guide, first select <em>Hosted Services, Storage Accounts &amp; CDN, Storage Accounts, </em>then <em>New Storage Account.</em><br/>
<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Create_New_Storage_Account.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Create_New_Storage_Account_thumb.png" alt="Create_New_Storage_Account" /></a></p></li>
<li><p> This will open the <em>Create a New Storage Account_dialog, where you will need to provide the details for the Storage Account that you would like to create.
<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Create_a_Storage_Account.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Create_a_Storage_Account_thumb.png" alt="Create_a_Storage_Account" /></a>The first of which is the URL that you would like to use. This needs to be unique across the entire Windows Azure infrastructure so you may need to get a little creative with your choice of name. You will be prompted with an error message if you enter something that isn’t allowed.<br/>
<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Error_-_dont_use_capitals.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Error_-_dont_use_capitals_thumb.png" alt="Error_-_don't_use_capitals" /></a>
The next piece of information is the </em>region or affinity group_ that you want your Blob Storage Account to be located. Microsoft has several Data Centers located across the world, including Anywhere US, South Central US, Anywhere Europe, West Europe, Anywhere Asia, Southeast Asia, East Asia, North Central US, North Europe. Simply pick the region that makes most sense to your location.
Click OK.</p></li>
<li><p> Your Storage Account will now get created. There will be a slight delay as your Account is first “Creating…”<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Storage_Account_Creating.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Storage_Account_Creating_thumb.png" alt="Storage_Account_Creating" /></a>Then “Resolving DNS…”<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Storage_Account_Resolving_DNS.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Storage_Account_Resolving_DNS_thumb.png" alt="Storage_Account_Resolving_DNS" /></a>But the end result will be your Storage Account will be “Created”<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Storage_Account_Created.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Storage_Account_Created_thumb.png" alt="Storage_Account_Created" /></a></p></li>
<li><p> If you select your new Storage Account, on the right hand side of the Windows Azure Portal you will see all of the properties for this new Storage Account:<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Storage_Account_Properties.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Storage_Account_Properties_thumb.png" alt="Storage_Account_Properties" />
</a>The main ones of interest are the “Keys”, which we will use later to connect to the Blob Storage Account from WordPress, and the Blob URL. The Blob URL is the publicly routable URL for accessing your Blob Storage account. Any files you upload to the Blob Storage Account will be accessible using this URL as a prefix. As you can see though, this URL is slightly long, and when used in the context of existing website, say gep13.co.uk, it bears no relation to it. However, this is something we can change by applying a Custom Domain to the Storage Account.</p></li>
<li><p> Select your Storage Account, and then press <em>Add Domain</em>, as shown below:<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Add_Custom_Domain.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Add_Custom_Domain_thumb.png" alt="Add_Custom_Domain" /></a></p></li>
<li><p> In the <em>Add a Custom Domain </em>Dialog, enter the domain name that you would like to use for this Storage Account. In my case, I wanted to use cdn.gep13.co.uk:<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Add_Custom_Domain_Name.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Add_Custom_Domain_Name_thumb.png" alt="Add_Custom_Domain_Name" /></a>Press OK.</p></li>
<li><p> At this point, Windows Azure will begin to create the Custom Domain name:<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Custom_Domain_Name_being_created.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Custom_Domain_Name_being_created_thumb.png" alt="Custom_Domain_Name_being_created" /></a></p></li>
<li><p> Once the initial process for the Custom Domain creation has completed, you will then have to validate that the domain name that you want to use actually belongs to you:<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Validate_Custom_Domain_Name.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Validate_Custom_Domain_Name_thumb.png" alt="Validate_Custom_Domain_Name" /></a>In order to do this, you will need to log into your Domain Registrar and alter the DNS Records for your domain to include a new CNAME record. The details for this record are provided for you, as per the above screenshot, so simply enter these details into your Domain Registrar site. As an example, this is what I had to do:<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Add_Verify_Domain_to_Registrar.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Add_Verify_Domain_to_Registrar_thumb.png" alt="Add_Verify_Domain_to_Registrar" /></a>Depending on how your Domain Registrar user interface works, remember to include the “.” at the end of the Canonical name, otherwise the DNS Record will not be accepted. Your new DNS record will take a while to propagate across the internet, so in the meantime, simply close the above <em>Validate Custom Domain</em> window, and you will see that your Custom Domain creation is in a <em>Pending </em>state:<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Custom_Domain_Name_Pending.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Custom_Domain_Name_Pending_thumb.png" alt="Custom_Domain_Name_Pending" /></a></p></li>
</ol>


<p>At this point, you might want to jump to Step 11.</p>

<ol>
<li>. Once enough time has passed (I waited a couple of hours) return to the Windows Azure portal and select your domain and click Validate Domain:<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Validate_Custom_Domain_Name_001.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Validate_Custom_Domain_Name_001_thumb.png" alt="Validate_Custom_Domain_Name_001" /></a>If everything worked correctly you will see:<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Domain_validated.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Domain_validated_thumb.png" alt="Domain_validated" /></a>However, depending on how long you waited, you might see this:<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Validation_Failed.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Validation_Failed_thumb.png" alt="Validation_Failed" /></a></li>
</ol>


<p>If you do, don’t worry, this simply means that the DNS Settings haven’t finished propagating, so try again later.</p>

<ol>
<li>. The only other thing left to do on this side of things is to create another CNAME record which will do the work of redirecting any requests to your Custom Domain, to your Blob Storage Account. All this means is that you need a CNAME record that has something like the following:<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/CNAME_for_redirect.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/CNAME_for_redirect_thumb.png" alt="CNAME_for_redirect" /></a>This is a redirect from the Custom Domain Name that you created, to the Blob URL for your storage account that was highlighted in Step 5 above. In order to say time, you might want to think about creating this CNAME record at the same time as you create the verify CNAME, that way you won’t have to wait a second lot of propagation time.</li>
</ol>


<h1></h1>

<h1>configure your Blob Storage Account</h1>

<ol>
<li><p> Now that the Blob Storage Account has been created, and Custom Domain established, we have a little bit of work to do in order to first configure the Blob Storage Account for use. It is easiest to do this using a 3rd Party Tool. There are a couple of main ones out there, the first being from <a href="http://cerebrata.com/">Redgate</a> (who acquired Cerebrata) and you can get a trial version of their software, and also <a href="http://clumsyleaf.com/products/cloudxplorer">CloudXplorer from ClumsyLeaf</a>. For the purposes of this walk through, I will be using CloudXplorer, so go ahead and get that installed.</p></li>
<li><p> Open CloudXplorer and select File | Accounts and the _Manage accounts_window opens:<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Manage_Accounts.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Manage_Accounts_thumb.png" alt="Manage_Accounts" /></a></p></li>
<li><p> Click the New… button and then select Windows Azure Account… and the <em>Windows Azure account </em>window will open:<br/>
<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/New_Windows_Azure_Account.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/New_Windows_Azure_Account_thumb.png" alt="New_Windows_Azure_Account" /></a></p></li>
<li><p> Using the information from step 5 above, enter the details of the Blob Storage Account that we created, where “Secret Key:” equates to the “Primary Access Key” (simply click View button to bring this up) and Name: is the Name of your Blob Storage Account, i.e. in my case gep13wpstorage.
<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Windows_Azure_Account_Window.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Windows_Azure_Account_Window_thumb.png" alt="Windows_Azure_Account_Window" /></a></p></li>
<li><p> With the account in place, the first thing we need to do is to create a container within the Blob Storage Account. This will let us compartmentalise files into the correct location. Right click in the right hand window of CloudXplorer and select New | Container…<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/CloudXplorer_Create_Container.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/CloudXplorer_Create_Container_thumb.png" alt="CloudXplorer_Create_Container" /></a></p></li>
<li><p> In the <em>Create directory/container </em>window, enter the name for your container. I went for “myuploads”.
<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Create_New_Container.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Create_New_Container_thumb.png" alt="Create_New_Container" /></a></p></li>
<li><p> Now we need to set the properties of the container to allow public access. Right click on the container that you just created and select Properties.<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Container_Properties.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Container_Properties_thumb.png" alt="Container_Properties" /></a></p></li>
<li><p> In the myloads Properties window, select the Policies tab and then select &ldquo;<em>Full public read access</em>” in the Access control drop down list, then select ok.<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Container_Policies.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Container_Policies_thumb.png" alt="Container_Policies" /></a></p></li>
</ol>


<h1>configure WordPress</h1>

<p>At this point, you have a number of options to set up your WordPress site to use Windows Azure as it’s repository for static content. Microsoft have actually released their own WordPress plugin which does just that. If you are interested, you can find this <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/windows-azure-storage/">here</a>. I ended up not using this particular plugin. As far as I could see, the onus was on you to manually move the files into your Azure container. Now, this isn’t hard to do, using the CloudXplorer I showed earlier, files can easily be copied into the container, but I wanted something a little more integrated.</p>

<p>I ended up using the excellent W3 Total Cache plugin which you can find <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/w3-total-cache/">here</a>. Again, the complete setup and configuration of this plugin is out with the scope of this particular blog post (I might write another one on this), however, the main thing to know is that there are a number of potential endpoints for this plugin including:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/W3TC_CDN_Options.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/W3TC_CDN_Options_thumb.png" alt="W3TC_CDN_Options" /></a></p>

<p>As you will see, I have chosen Microsoft Azure Storage. From there, you can then specify the options for connecting to Windows Azure:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/CDN_Settings.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/CDN_Settings_thumb.png" alt="CDN_Settings" /></a></p>

<p>Including the Custom Domain name which we set up earlier (if you can remember that far back).</p>

<p>With that in place, you can then use the W3 Total Cache plugin to move all the necessary files into your Blob Storage Account. You can simply click on each of the required buttons:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/General_Settings.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/General_Settings_thumb.png" alt="General_Settings" /></a></p>

<p>Then, with all the files uploaded, and W3 Total Cache activated, it will rewrite all of the URL’s for all of your static content to come from your Blob Storage Account. Feel free to take a look and see this in action by right clicking on the view source of this page, and searching for cdn.gep13.co.uk.</p>

<p>And that, as they say, is that! If you have any questions, please feel free to get in touch.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/windows-phone-7-bootcamp-uk-tech-days/" itemprop="url">Windows Phone 7 Bootcamp, UK Tech Days</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Today, I attended the Windows Phone 7 Bootcamp, which was organised by Microsoft and <a href="http://uktechdays.cloudapp.net/home.aspx">UK Tech Days</a>. The event was also being supported by the Windows Phone MVP’s from <a href="http://appamundi.com/">Appamundi</a>.  You can find details of this event <a href="http://uktechdays.cloudapp.net/upcoming-events/windows-phone-camp-(london">here</a>.aspx).  This was hot on the heels of the Windows Azure Bootcamp which I <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/windows-azure-bootcamp-uk-tech-days/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=windows-azure-bootcamp-uk-tech-days">attended yesterday</a>.  The event broke down as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A series of sessions covering:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Design Session: User Journey</p></li>
<li><p>Intro to Windows Phone Dev</p></li>
<li><p>Controls &amp; Control Toolkit</p></li>
<li><p>Execution Model</p></li>
<li><p>Storing Data</p></li>
<li><p>Launchers and hookers</p></li>
<li><p>Background Tasks</p></li>
<li><p>Marketplace &amp; Submissions</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>A series of Hands On Labs</p></li>
</ul>


<p>In a change to the “normal” format of these events, each of the sessions were voluntary.  The idea was that you could dip in and out of the sessions, and carry on with “Hands on Labs”, or ask questions of the volunteer helpers, or socialize with the other attendees.  I have to say that I wasn’t prepared for this format, I was instead expecting a similar format to the Bootcamp yesterday (i.e. a more rigid structure), but I have to say, that it worked.</p>

<p>I think that this was helped by the fact that the venue was set up to encourage interaction.  There were loads of open spaces to talk to delegates, a table tennis table, multiple table football tables, a pool table, and comfortable seats.  The only thing that I would say is, when you were in the auditorium trying to listen to the speaker, the sound of people playing table tennis was slightly off-putting, but that is a minor complaint.</p>

<p>I have to say a big shout out to <a href="http://www.thehitandrun.com/">hit+run</a>, you can find them on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/hnrcrew_europe">here</a>.  They were creating custom Windows Phone 7 t-shirts, which each attendee got for free.  There was a “huge” queue to get one, but the end result was very impressive, and worth the wait!  Thanks!</p>

<p>As per yesterday, I would thoroughly recommend that if you get a chance to attend a UK Tech Days event, you should definitely grab it.  For a list of upcoming events, you can check out this list <a href="http://uktechdays.cloudapp.net/upcoming-events.aspx">here</a>.</p>

<h1>Looking ahead…</h1>

<p>I asked this question yesterday, with regard to Windows Azure, but what am I going to do, going forward, with Windows Phone?  The answer to this question is, a lot!  This is for a couple of reasons, not least because of the brand new, shiny, <a href="http://www.nokia.com/gb-en/products/phone/lumia800?sissr=1#">Nokia Lumia 800</a>, which I got while I attended this event!  Oh sorry, did I not mention that until just now <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/wlEmoticon-smile1.png" alt="Smile" />.  Yes, you heard me correct, I received a free <a href="http://www.nokia.com/gb-en/products/phone/lumia800?sissr=1#">Nokia Lumia 800</a>.  In attendance at the event were representatives of Nokia who are running a program where if you can prove that you intend to create and publish an app onto the Windows Phone Marketplace, they will give you a phone.  I have been toying with the idea of doing a couple of applications, and this is really the reason that I wanted to attend this Bootcamp, to give me the “kick” to get them done.  I knocked up a quick storyboard to indicate the intention of my first application, and with that in place, I put this to them, and they gave me a phone.  Huge thank you to Nokia!!!</p>

<p>So, if nothing else, I will be creating a Windows Phone 7 application in the next month.  However, I really feel that this platform has a lot going for it, and I definitely want to get more involved with it, and I am actually thinking about doing some talks on it in the near future.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/windows-azure-bootcamp-uk-tech-days/" itemprop="url">Windows Azure Bootcamp, UK Tech Days</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Today, I attended the Windows Azure Bootcamp, which was organised by Microsoft and <a href="http://uktechdays.cloudapp.net/home.aspx">UK Tech Days</a>.  You can find details of this event <a href="http://uktechdays.cloudapp.net/upcoming-events/windows-azure-bootcamp-(london">here</a>.aspx).  I was really looking forward to attending this event, as Windows Azure is something that I have been interested in getting into for a while.  I am happy to say that I was not disappointed, it really was a great event!  The event broke down as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>An overview of Windows Azure</p></li>
<li><p>Overview of Storage, Web, and Worker Role – followed by a hands on lab</p></li>
<li><p>Overview of SQL Azure – followed by a hands on lab</p></li>
<li><p>Overview of App Fab (now known as Service Bus and ACS) – followed by a hands on lab</p></li>
<li><p>Question and Answer session</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I was really impressed with the hands on labs, and the overall structure of the day.  The only thing that I would say is that at some points, the presenters did start to lose the audience, and there was a lot of chatter across the room.  This was rather distracting at times, and made it really difficult to hear and understand what they were trying to say.</p>

<p>With each lab, the sample application slowly built into a complete application, that utilised a Web Role, a Worker Role (using the queue), along with Blob Storage, and a SQL Azure Database.  There are some very complicated situations within Azure, and creating an application like this, meant that you could easily see how each piece fitted together.</p>

<p>I would highly recommend attending a UK Tech Days event to anyone, and if you are interested in other events that are coming up, I would suggest that you take a look <a href="http://uktechdays.cloudapp.net/upcoming-events.aspx">here</a>.  I am happy to say that I am attending another event tomorrow <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" />.</p>

<h1>Where to find Azure resources</h1>

<p>Following this Windows Azure event, it is clear that there is a growing number of resources for getting started with Windows Azure, and what follows is a list of the links that was provided on the day.  I will certainly be checking some of these out:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://sixweeksofazure.wordpress.com/">6 Weeks of Azure</a></p>

<ul>
<li>This is a course of training sessions, organised and run by Eric Nelson (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ericnel">@ericnel</a>).  This series has already been running for the last two weeks, but there is still plenty of reasons to join.  I would <em>highly </em>recommend that you register and attend the next session which is on Monday</li>
</ul>

<h1>Book Recommendations</h1>

<p>One of the last questions that I asked before leaving the venue was whether or not there were any recommended books for learning Windows Azure.  The responses from Steve Plank, Steve Spencer, Andy Cross, and Richard Conway were the following:</p>

<h1>Looking ahead…</h1>

<p>So, what happens next?  Now that I have had this introduction to Windows Azure, what am I going to do with it.  The short answer is, I am not sure <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" />.  I am very interested in looking into the VM Role within Windows Azure, and how I could make use of that, and having just set up my WordPress Blog to use the Amazon S3 system as a CDN, I think I am going to look into using Azure Storage for it instead.  I will post back if I end up using this.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>As some of you may know, I have been <em>hacking</em> on this WordPress blog site recently.  The decision to &ldquo;improve&rdquo; this site has really come from the realisation that WordPress is actually very good at what it does, and I am going to <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/continue-using-wordpress-or-not/">continue using it for the foreseeable future</a>.  With that in mind, there were a few things that were annoying me about the site, so I started digging around the innards of WordPress to figure out what could be changed, and more importantly, how to do it.  To start with, this was done using the always useful FTP application, <a href="http://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a>.  I would download a .php file locally, make some changes to it, and then upload it again.  This cycle repeated for a few iterations, until I realised that there <em>must</em> be a better way to do this!</p>

<h1>Using the WordPress Editor</h1>

<p>Now, WordPress comes with its own built-in file editor, which gives you the ability to edit individual files.  This can be pretty much any file within WordPress, be it, plugins, themes, script files, etc.  However, the editor itself is very basic, and I quickly became annoyed at using it:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/WordPress_Editor.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/WordPress_Editor_thumb.png" alt="WordPress_Editor" /></a></p>

<h1>Using an Online IDE</h1>

<p>Then I remembered about a conversation had with Phil Leggetter (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/leggetter">@leggetter</a>) and Daniel Elliot (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/agileguy">@agileguy</a>) while I was at <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/my-impressions-of-givecampuk/">GiveCamp UK</a> last year, and the idea of using an online IDE to do the work started to become more appealing.  This would mean that I could &ldquo;hack&rdquo; on the files directly from within the browser, but still get the added benefits, such as syntax highlighting.  A quick search, and it turns out that there are lots of online IDE&rsquo;s out there.  Here are some of the ones that I tried out:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://coderun.com/ide/">coderun</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://shiftedit.net/">ShiftEdit</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://codeanywhere.net/">codeanywhere</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://c9.io/">Cloud9 IDE</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>The requirements for what I wanted were quite simple:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Be free (yes, I am a cheap skate, but for now, what I need to use it for doesn&rsquo;t warrant paying for the service)</p></li>
<li><p> Allow editing of files on a FTP Server</p></li>
<li><p> Syntax Highlighting</p></li>
<li><p> Allow private projects</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Due to requirement 1 <a href="http://coderun.com/ide/">coderun</a> was not able to be used.  Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, this is a GREAT application, and if I was looking to code full-blown ASP.Net applications in the cloud, this would definitely be one of the go to applications.  That left three applications to whittle down.</p>

<p>Although it claims to be able to do it, I couldn&rsquo;t get <a href="https://codeanywhere.net/">codeanywhere</a> to connect to my FTP Server (and this wasn&rsquo;t for want of trying) so I gave up on using that.  That left <a href="http://shiftedit.net/">ShiftEdit</a> and <a href="http://c9.io/">Cloud9 IDE</a>.</p>

<p>I played with both of these, on and off, while I was doing my hacking, and I have to say that they are both very good.  Both are free (depending on what you want to do with them), and I found it hard to choose between them.  After a good bit of consideration, I have decided to continue using <a href="http://c9.io/">Cloud9 IDE</a>.  This was for a couple of reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Although <a href="http://shiftedit.net/">ShiftEdit</a> is free (for what I wanted to do) it didn&rsquo;t offer SSL access, which was a bit of a downer</p></li>
<li><p> <a href="http://c9.io/">Cloud9 IDE</a> seems to be under far more active development, with exciting recent announcements about <a href="http://cloud9ide.posterous.com/windows-azure-on-cloud9">Azure integration</a></p></li>
</ol>


<p>One thing I should note about <a href="http://c9.io/">Cloud9 IDE</a>, is that in order to secure access to your projects you normally need to purchase the premium subscription, i.e:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Create_New_Project.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Create_New_Project_thumb.png" alt="Create_New_Project" /></a></p>

<p>However, when it comes to FTP projects, it is only you that gets access:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Create_New_Project_-_FTP.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Create_New_Project_-_FTP_thumb.png" alt="Create_New_Project_-_FTP" /></a></p>

<p>Now, I have to admit that other people getting access to my FTP Server was something that I was worried about, and I wanted to test to make sure that it wasn&rsquo;t publicly accessible.  To test this I sent a DM on Twitter to Phil Leggetter and asked him to try to get in, and this is what he was met with:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/denied-access.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/denied-access_thumb.png" alt="denied access" /></a></p>

<p>However, what is interesting, is that you &ldquo;can&rdquo; grant access to users through the <a href="http://c9.io/">Cloud9 IDE</a> dashboard, once they request access, which is a really nice touch:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Cloud9_Dashboard.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Cloud9_Dashboard_thumb.png" alt="Cloud9_Dashboard" /></a></p>

<p>Sorry Phil, I denied your request to join the project :).</p>

<p>All in all, this is a VERY polished application, and I would highly recommend checking it out.  The GitHub and BitBucket integration is seamless, and <em>just</em> works!  Make sure you check it out.</p>

<p>If you are interested in checking out the result of my <em>hacking </em>I have uploaded my changes to my GitHub site <a href="https://github.com/gep13/NowReadingReloaded13">here</a>.</p>
