<h1>First Morning Session at DevWeek Day 2</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Mike Taulty (you can find him on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/mtaulty">@mtaulty</a> and his <a href="http://mtaulty.com/communityserver/blogs/mike_taultys_blog/default.aspx">blog</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Topic: </strong>Technical Keynote – Windows 8 for application developers</p>

<blockquote>Windows 8 is Windows re-imagined for new devices, form-factors and chipsets embracing and unifying touch as a first-class input mechanism and providing a new platform for fast and fluid Metro style applications that put the application and the user front and centre. Developing Metro style applications involves a new set of tooling in Visual Studio and new versions of Expression Blend where you can author your UI in HTML or XAML and write your logic in JavaScript, C# or C++. The new WinRT runtime provides APIs that expose platform capabilities like storage, networking, media and also provides access to the contracts that let Windows loosely link your applications with others on the user’s machine.
This session will set the scene for the Windows 8 operating system and Windows 8 “Metro Style” applications, and the huge opportunity that they offer you as an application developer.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>For a lot of reasons, I have not been in a position to play with either Windows 8 or Visual Studio 11.  I have both of the Developer previews downloaded but I haven’t installed them.  As a result, it was great to see both of these items being used in anger, and Mike Taulty provided a very good overview of how the twos things can be used together.</p>

<p>There were a couple of times when the demonstration didn’t go quite the way that I think Mike wanted it to, but if this in any way flustered him, it wasn’t obvious.  The problems that did crop up were nothing major and to be expected with running a Consumer Technical Preview on a prototype device.</p>

<p>Of particular interest was seeing how .NET assemblies could be created and consumed within a Metro Application using HTML5 and JavaScript.  This did involve jumping through a few hoops by first converting the Project Type to use WinMD, and also meant creating a “copy” of the returned object since it couldn’t be used directly.  All in all though, it was a very impressive demonstration of what could be done.</p>

<p>A couple interesting links that came out of the session:</p>

<h1>Second Morning Session at DevWeek Day 2</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Dino Esposito (you can find him on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/despos">@despos</a> and his <a href="http://www.expoware.org/">site</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Topic: </strong>ASP.NET MVC: Programming for the real world</p>

<blockquote>You cannot realistically write an ASP.NET MVC controller class without making extensive use of action filters. In ASP.NET MVC, an action filter affects the way in which controller methods execute. An action filter can be used to trap exceptions, authorise access, cache output, and validate requests. This is only the first stage of flexibility, however. In this session, we’ll first see how to create custom filters to perform a variety of custom tasks including compressing the response, adapting to the browser, filling up view dependencies. Up to here, however, filters are only attached to methods statically. The next step consists of defining an infrastructure for you to load filters dynamically thus gaining the ability to toggle certain behaviour on or off on the fly.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>Having read the description for this session, I was very much looking forward to it.  I have never seen a presentation from Dino before, but it has to be said that he is a very good presenter!  He is obviously very passionate about the topic, and you can’t help but get swept up in his enthusiasm!</p>

<p>The main topic of this presentation was the use of Action Filters, and how these can be used to make your code more readable (the main point that Dino was trying to push throughout the session).</p>

<p>It was very interesting to see how an Action Filter can be used to intercept:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The start of the request</p></li>
<li><p>The end of the request</p></li>
<li><p>The start of the response</p></li>
<li><p>The end of the response</p></li>
</ul>


<p>and how code could be applied at any of these points.  One of the examples that was shown was the inclusion of logging to record how long the request took to execute.  Very interesting.</p>

<p>Dino then went on to show how the necessary Action Filter Attributes out of the code file into the configuration file, and then injected into the code.  The only problem that I had with this is that it potentially made the code “less” readable.  Without looking at the configuration file, in conjunction with the source code, there was no way to see which Action Filters were being applied where.</p>

<h1>First Afternoon Session at DevWeek Day 2</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Robert Boedigheimer (you can find him on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/boedie">@boedie</a> and his <a href="http://aspadvice.com/blogs/robertb">blog</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Topic: </strong>ASP.NET and Visual Studio 11</p>

<blockquote>Learn about the great new features coming in the next version of ASP.NET and Visual Studio. There are some great enhancements to all of the editors (CSS snippets, CSS vendor prefixes, JavaScript go to definition, etc). Discover the new model binding and repository capabilities in Web Forms, along with unobtrusive jQuery validation support for validators. See how to bundle and minify CSS and JavaScript files simply to drastically improve web site performance. A new script manager also supports debug, release, and CDN versions of files</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>As mentioned above, I haven’t played with Visual Studio 11, so I was very interested to see the changes that were coming in it.  The fact that the session was going to be focused on ASP.NET was a bit of a bonus!</p>

<p>Bottom line, ignoring all the arguments about the colour and icons and whether this is good or bad, the new Visual Studio has some very interesting features!  Some of the stand out items for me included:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Image Thumbnails in the Solution Explorer – very cool!</p></li>
<li><p>The new Preview Tab which brings up the file with a single click in the Solution Explorer</p></li>
<li><p>Matching tag renaming in the Source Editor</p></li>
<li><p>Attribute Code Intellisense</p></li>
<li><p>New Page Inspector which combines F12 Developer Tools type functionality directly in Visual Studio</p></li>
<li><p>Built in minification of CSS and JavaScript files, including ability to provide a hash code to the resulting bundle to ensure re-download when changes occur on the server</p></li>
<li><p>Support for HTML 5 Types from the TextBox Server Control</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Overall, I really enjoyed this session, not least because Robert is a very good speaker, there are a lot of great features going in this next release of Visual Studio and I am very much looking forward to starting to use it.  The fact that you can “round trip” projects between Visual Studio 11 and Visual Studio 2010 (assuming you don’t use any new features in .NET 4.5) will make the transition to this use IDE much easier!</p>

<h1>Second Afternoon Session at DevWeek Day 2</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Dave Wheeler (you can find him on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/coloringinguy">@coloringinguy</a> and his <a href="http://coloringinguy.com/">blog</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Topic: </strong>A .NET developer’s guide to WinRT</p>

<blockquote>Come to this session to find out how to consume and interact with WinRT from managed code.
Learn how to write WinRT components; how to integrate them with C++ and JavaScript code; and just how natural and fluid it is to work with WinRT from managed code.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>Having listened to Mike Taulty’s keynote speech around Metro and WinRT, I was hoping to get some more information regarding the innards of developing with it in this session, and I wasn’t disappointed.  Dave did a great job of cutting through some the marketing regarding Metro and WinRT and basically told it how it is.  This is not to say that he slated Metro or WinRT in any way, that certainly wasn’t the case, but rather, simply told it how it is.</p>

<p>He made is clear that much like it was with Silverlight Development, certain things will not be available when doing Metro Development.  This is due to the new .Net Core Profile.  For instance, although you will be able to use LINQ to Objects, there is no LINQ to SQL, or LINQ to Entities.  This is mainly due to the fact that there is no support for ADO.NET in WinRT.</p>

<p>As with the other talks today, this one was also very good, and it ended a very enjoyable first day of sessions at DevWeek.</p>

		<p>What follows is a brief summary of the final day of <a href="http://www.devweek.com/">DevWeek 2012</a>.  It has been a very long, but also a very enjoyable, week and I have to give a lot of credit of all of the organisers, speakers and sponsors for putting on a great conference.  Congratulations to Nick Payne of <a href="http://www.bearpark.co.uk/">Bearkpark Publishing</a> for organising everything!  Reviews of the other days of DevWeek can be seen here:</p>

<h1>Post-Conference Workshop at DevWeek</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter:</strong> Kevin Jones (you can find him on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/kevinrjones">@kevinrjones</a> and his <a href="http://www.rocksolidknowledge.com/">site</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Topic:</strong> A day of unit testing</p>

<blockquote>Unit testing has become more prevalent over the last few years as more and more teams have come to realise the importance of ensuring code has some degree of test coverage. Developers are aware that code quality is an important issue and that to get high quality code they often need to refactor. Refactoring safely requires unit tests. We will spend the day looking at unit testing, how to write a unit test, how to test external resources such as databases and web services, how to work with legacy code and how to ensure that your code is designed to be tested.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> I actually got a lot from this session.  Not only is Kevin a great speaker, but he was able to provide lots of real life experiences with regard to how he has used Unit Testing in the various jobs that he has had.  I have done a lot of reading on the subject of Unit Testing but for one reason or another have not been able to fully implement at my place of work the way that I would like to.  What I particularly liked about this session was the pragmatic approach that Kevin used to implementing Unit Testing.</p>

<p>In this day long session, Kevin talked through lots of topics that you would expect in a session like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Unit Testing</p></li>
<li><p>Integration Testing</p></li>
<li><p>Mocking</p></li>
<li><p>Dependency Injection</p></li>
<li><p>Inversion of Control</p></li>
</ul>


<p>However, what was really impressive about this session was the final demonstration which brought everything together into one concrete demonstration application.  This included:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Starting with a blank ASP.NET MVC Application which would use Unity</p></li>
<li><p>Adding a new Integration Test Project and added Specflow, Selenium and NUnit</p></li>
<li><p>Adding a new Unit Test Project and added NUnit</p></li>
<li><p>Created a Specflow Feature and Scenario and saw it fail</p></li>
<li><p>Created some Unit Tests and saw them fail</p></li>
<li><p>Implemented the necessary code, i.e. Controller and View to make the tests pass</p></li>
<li><p>Refactored the code to include repository pattern for Database access using Entity Framework and Unity for injecting a repository instance whilst ensuring Tests continued to pass, as well as mocking the repository for testing purposes</p></li>
</ul>


<p>All in all, this single demonstration brought everything together for me, and it really hammered home all the topics of the day.  Very well done!!</p>

<p>In addition, Kevin is also working on a blog application which demonstrates the use of all of these frameworks and strategies.  You can find this on his GiHub account <a href="https://github.com/kevinrjones/mblog">here</a>.  Bear in mind, this application has been created in Visual Studio 11 using .NET Framework 4.5 and the Beta edition of Entity Framework 5, so if you want to play with it, you will need to have all of these installed somewhere.</p>

<p>Thanks for a great session Kevin!!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>This morning I found another notification to indicate that there was an update for my Windows Phone 7, Nokia Lumia 800 Handset.  Given the <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/nokia-lumia-800-to-get-tethering-support-soon/">recent announcement</a>, I hurriedly set about getting the update installed.</p>

<p>In the style of my previous Windows Phone 7 update posts, here are some of the screenshots that I took along the update process:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/2012-03-30_0801.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/2012-03-30_0801_thumb.png" alt="Update for Windows Phone 7 Available" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/2012-03-30_0806.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/2012-03-30_0806_thumb.png" alt="Update Your Phone in Zune" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/2012-03-30_0824.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/2012-03-30_0824_thumb.png" alt="Update of Windows Phone 7 Complete" /></a></p>

<p>As soon as the update was completed, and the Windows Phone 7 handset had rebooted, I straight away went into the Settings menu where I was sure that I was going to find the <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/update-7-10-7710-68-for-windows-phone-7-wp7/">Internet Sharing</a> option, but unfortunately, it is still not there!</p>

<p>On doing some searching, I turned up this <a href="http://discussions.europe.nokia.com/t5/Nokia-with-Windows-Phone/Heads-up-on-Lumia-800-update-1600-2487-8107-12070/td-p/1361057">Nokia Support Discussion</a> which explains that this update does:</p>

<blockquote>

> 
> 
    
>   * brings significant improvements in battery performance, especially in 3G talk time as well as in predictive usage time, standby time, WiFi browsing time and music playback time.
> 
    
>   * Improved bass in audio performance
> 
    
>   * The back, start, and search keys are lit according to screen brightness settings
> 
    
>   * Fix to prevent rebooting in certain network conditions
> 
    
>   * Fix for call hang up issues in certain markets
> 

</blockquote>


<p>These things are all great, and I had actually noticed the rebooting of the phone when starting up initially, so I am glad that this is fixed, however, I still REALLY want to be able to tether my laptop to my Windows Phone 7.</p>

<p>Hopefully the next update from Nokia for the Windows Phone 7 will include this functionality, and further, I hope that my current mobile operator supports this function (which I have been told that they do).</p>

<p>For those interested in version numbers etc, this update took my Windows Phone 7 from:</p>

<p>Firmware Revision Number: <strong>1600.2483.8106.11500 </strong>to <strong>1600.2487.8107.12070</strong></p>

<h1>Pre-Conference Workshop at DevWeek</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Jeff Prosise (you can find his blog <a href="http://www.wintellect.com/cs/blogs/jprosise/">here</a> and his twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jprosise">here</a>:</p>

<p><strong>Topic: </strong>HTML5 Workshop</p>

<blockquote>HTML 5 is the newest version of HTML, and it is taking the programming world by storm. It combines new markup elements with a host of new JavaScript APIs to bring HTML into the 21st century and to enable developers to build rich, feature-filled Web applications without relying on browser plug-ins such as Silverlight and Flash.
In this full-day pre-conference tutorial, we’ll take a deep dive into HTML 5 and show all the bells and whistles, including new markup elements, browser support, audio and video, the canvas API, local storage, web workers, geolocation, and much, much more.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> In house, we are heavily invested in Silverlight, however, HTML 5, although still not officially a standard, and yet to be fully implemented in browsers, is certainly making waves, and I was very interested to hear about what it is, what it does, and what actually works.  The day long workshop was broken up into the following sections:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Introduction</p></li>
<li><p>Geolocation</p></li>
<li><p>Audio and Video</p></li>
<li><p>Canvas</p></li>
<li><p>Web Workers</p></li>
<li><p>Web Storage</p></li>
<li><p>Files</p></li>
<li><p>Drag and Drop</p></li>
<li><p>Networking</p></li>
</ul>


<p>With each section, Jeff had a number of very good demonstrations with he was able to show working (in some cases this meant switching between different browsers), and this really helped to concrete the topics that were being explained.</p>

<p>If you are interested in seeing the demo code, it is available for download <a href="http://wintellect.com/downloads/html5.zip">here</a>.  As a suggestion to Jeff, if he is reading, I think it would be great if these samples were to make them onto something like GitHub.  With the rate at which the HTML 5 specification is evolving, along with changes to browsers implementations, having the code in GitHub would allow it to be easier maintained and updated.  Just an idea.</p>

<p>One thing that I really enjoyed about todays workshops were the synergies that Jeff was able to bring to the table.  With a background in Silverlight, Jeff was able to give honest opinions about how things differed between the two technologies.  Both the good and the bad.  This really helped!!  I think the important thing is going to be knowing when to use HTML 5.  In some places it is going to make sense to use it, in others, continuing to use Silverlight (which is due to be supported for the next 10 years) is still going to make sense.</p>

<p>All in all, Jeff was a great speaker, and I really enjoyed this day long introduction to HTML 5.  I am very much looking forward to the rest of the week, and looking ahead at the sessions available Jeff has a number of other sessions which I am now thinking about attending.  The problem here being that there are SO many good sessions on offer, than choosing between them is going to be very hard!  For the Post Conference Workshop I am signed up for “A day of unit testing” with Kevin Jones, which I think will be a really useful day!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I have just found out that the much-needed internet tethering feature for my Nokia Lumia 800 is coming, it just hasn’t been announced when it will be arriving.  The only hint that we get is via an online <a href="http://nokiaconnects.com/2012/03/13/nokia-lumia-900-your-questions-answered/">Q&amp;A blog post on the Nokia Connects site</a>, which states:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/image.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/image_thumb.png" alt="Nokia Lumia 800 to get tethering support" /></a></p>

<p>This really is great news, and although it has not been confirmed when this update will be shipped, the confirmation that this feature is actually coming to the Nokia Lumia 800 is in itself huge news.</p>

<p>I have recently moved mobile phone operator specifically for the reason that I wanted an unlimited data contract, and the fact that the Nokia Lumia 800 couldn’t tether is a real pain as it means I have to switch SIM between my HTC HD7 which does have the feature.  I personally can’t wait for this update to be released!</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/office-365-is-now-free-for-user-groups/" itemprop="url">Office 365 Is Now Free for User Groups</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Back in June 2011, I asked an <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/can-net-user-groups-get-office365-for-free/">open question</a> to the community regarding Office 365.  The question was simple….</p>

<blockquote>Can .Net User Groups get Office 365 for free?</blockquote>


<p>To me, it seemed like a simple enough question, however, at the time, it seemed that there was no simple answer.  Once the Office 365 Beta that I was using for managing the <a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/">Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group</a> email expired, I transitioned to using a paid P1 plan.  This was for a number of reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The Office 365 Service is very good!  It does exactly what it says on the tin, and I had already done the hard work of setting up the domain, and getting it all working.</p></li>
<li><p>As I mentioned in my earlier blog post, it is not a huge amount of money for the service, so I was happy to pay for it.  The only slight problem being that other members of the User Group simply use email aliases, rather than having a full-blown mailbox, as we couldn’t warrant paying for an account for everyone.</p></li>
<li><p>There was still no confirmation on whether we could, or could not get it for free.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>However, thanks to an email from Andrew Westgarth (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/apwestgarth">@apwestgarth</a>), I am happy to be able to let you know that through <a href="https://www.technicalcommunity.com/Pages/default.aspx">UGSS</a> (User Group Support Services), it is now possible to get an E3 Office 365 Plan for your User Group.  Full details of the offer can be found here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.microsofttraining.com/office365/">http://www.microsofttraining.com/office365/</a></p>

<p>I have just started the registration process, so I haven’t got this all setup yet, but if I run into any problems, I will let you know.  I am hoping that there isn’t going to be a problem with already having a paid Office 365 Plan, as the registration instructions mention starting a trial Office 365 Plan, but we will wait and see.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I woke up this morning to find that my shiny new Windows Phone 7, the Nokia Lumia 800, was telling me that I had a new update.</p>

<p>As some of you will know, I REALLY like the Nokia Lumia 800, it is a great piece of hardware, but it has one killer feature missing, in my opinion.  This is the ability to tether the phone to my laptop using “Internet Sharing” as I could on my HTC HD7.</p>

<p>I have heard from both parties in this problem, i.e. Nokia and my mobile phone provider, and both say that it “should” work, but alas, it doesn’t.  I was sort of hoping that this new update would bring with it the ability to tether, but alas, it didn’t <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/wlEmoticon-sadsmile.png" alt="Sad smile" />.</p>

<p>In the style of my previous Windows Phone 7 update posts, here is the screen shot that greets you when you start to do this update:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Firmware_Update.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Firmware_Update_thumb.png" alt="Firmware_Update" /></a></p>

<p>This update took my Windows Phone 7 from:</p>

<p>Firmware Revision Number: <strong>1600.2479.7740.11451 </strong>to <strong>1600.2483.8106.11500</strong></p>

<p>Details of what is included in this particular update can be found <a href="http://conversations.nokia.com/2012/01/18/new-software-update-for-the-nokia-lumia-800/">here</a>.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Tonight I started to configure my new Windows Phone 7, the <a href="http://www.nokia.com/gb-en/products/phone/lumia800/">Nokia Lumia 800</a>.  I was lucky enough to receive this phone when I attended the <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/windows-phone-7-bootcamp-uk-tech-days/">Windows Phone 7 Bootcamp</a> in London, which was part of UK Tech Days, which is organised and run by Microsoft.</p>

<p>While doing this, I got a distinct feeling of <em>deja vu</em>, as I recently applied this <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/update-7-10-8107-79-for-windows-phone-7-wp7/">update for my HTC HD7</a>.</p>

<p>In the same way as the last time, the update itself went in without any problems.  One interesting difference between the two updates can be seen in the following screenshot though:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/2012-02-08_2014.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/2012-02-08_2014_thumb.png" alt="2012-02-08_2014" /></a></p>

<p>If you compare this to the previous screenshot, you will see that there is no mention of the “<em>HTC Update for Windows Phone”</em> which was present on the last update screen.</p>

<p>I had heard that mobile phone operators were pushing out their own updates, in this case HTC, but I have never seen it first hand.  It was also my understanding that mobile operators would come out with their own updates, not bundled with an Operating System update, but it appears that this also isn’t the case.</p>

<p>I would have also thought that in this case, the build number would also be different, in order to show what is, and what isn’t installed on a particular handset.  Quite why this hasn’t been done, I am not sure.  Perhaps this is what is included in the firmware version number for the handset.</p>

<p>I am now going through the process of re-installing the applications that I have on my HD7, onto my Lumia.  I asked the question while I was at the Bootcamp whether there was anyway to automate this process, but the answer was no.</p>

<p>One annoyance that I have found with the Nokia Lumia 800 is that at the minute, even after applying the latest update, the Internet Sharing function for the phone is not available.  Any noted <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/update-7-10-7710-68-for-windows-phone-7-wp7/">here</a> this is a fundamental feature on my current handset, and I am going to miss having it.  While I was at the Bootcamp I specifically asked the Nokia representative whether this feature was going to be available on the Lumia, and I was told that it would. be, assuming that the Mobile Operator enabled it.  However, after talking directly to 3 this afternoon, they are saying that it is Nokia that need to first enable this feature.</p>

<p>Having done some googling, it is not clear to me at this point who is right and who is wrong.  Even on Nokia’s own support forum there are <a href="http://discussions.europe.nokia.com/t5/Nokia-with-Windows-Phone/Internet-sharing-teathering-on-Lumia-800/td-p/1285135">mixed comments</a>.  I have seen references to an update being provided in early 2012, specifically from <a href="http://www.windowsphonedaily.com/2011/12/nokia-italy-internet-sharing-coming-to.html">Nokia Italy</a>.  Hopefully some more concrete news fill be released soon.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/use-a-windows-azure-blob-storage-account-with-your-wordpress-blog/" itemprop="url">Use a Windows Azure Blob Storage Account With Your WordPress Blog</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Hot on the heels of the <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/windows-azure-bootcamp-uk-tech-days/">Windows Azure Bootcamp</a> that I did this weekend, I decided that I wanted to do <em>something</em> with Windows Azure, that way I could practice what I had learnt, and begin to increase my exposure to what Windows Azure brings to the table. I decided that I wanted to use the Windows Azure Blob Storage to host all of the static content of my WordPress Blog, thus, <em>hopefully, </em>increasing the performance of my blog. What follows is a list of instructions for setting up your WordPress Blog, as well as your Windows Azure account, and also your domain registrar (in order to apply a shortened domain name to your Blob Storage Account).</p>

<p>This article breaks down into three main parts:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Set up your Blob Storage Account in the Windows Azure Portal, along with DNS settings for your Domain Registrar</p></li>
<li><p>Configure your Blob Storage Account using CloudXplorer</p></li>
<li><p>Set up a WordPress plugin to communicate with your Blob Storage Account</p></li>
</ol>


<p>So, let&rsquo;s get started!</p>

<h1>Setting up Windows Azure</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>The first thing that you are going to need is a Windows Azure Account. If you don’t already have one, there are a couple of ways that you can get one:</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/">Windows Azure 3 Month Free Trial</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits/">MSDN Subscribers can get Free Benefits</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/">A number of different paid subscriptions</a></p></li>
<li><p>Once you have logged into your Windows Azure account, you will be presented with a huge selection of options, the scope of which are far out with the intention of this blog post, as a result, only the specific options to enable Blob Storage will be discussed here. Using the picture to the below as a guide, first select <em>Hosted Services, Storage Accounts &amp; CDN, Storage Accounts, </em>then <em>New Storage Account.</em><br/>
<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Create_New_Storage_Account.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Create_New_Storage_Account_thumb.png" alt="Create_New_Storage_Account" /></a></p></li>
<li><p>This will open the <em>Create a New Storage Account_dialog, where you will need to provide the details for the Storage Account that you would like to create.
<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Create_a_Storage_Account.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Create_a_Storage_Account_thumb.png" alt="Create_a_Storage_Account" /></a>The first of which is the URL that you would like to use. This needs to be unique across the entire Windows Azure infrastructure so you may need to get a little creative with your choice of name. You will be prompted with an error message if you enter something that isn’t allowed.<br/>
<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Error_-_dont_use_capitals.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Error_-_dont_use_capitals_thumb.png" alt="Error_-_don't_use_capitals" /></a>
The next piece of information is the </em>region or affinity group_ that you want your Blob Storage Account to be located. Microsoft has several Data Centers located across the world, including Anywhere US, South Central US, Anywhere Europe, West Europe, Anywhere Asia, Southeast Asia, East Asia, North Central US, North Europe. Simply pick the region that makes most sense to your location.
Click OK.</p></li>
<li><p>Your Storage Account will now get created. There will be a slight delay as your Account is first “Creating…”<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Storage_Account_Creating.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Storage_Account_Creating_thumb.png" alt="Storage_Account_Creating" /></a>Then “Resolving DNS…”<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Storage_Account_Resolving_DNS.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Storage_Account_Resolving_DNS_thumb.png" alt="Storage_Account_Resolving_DNS" /></a>But the end result will be your Storage Account will be “Created”<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Storage_Account_Created.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Storage_Account_Created_thumb.png" alt="Storage_Account_Created" /></a></p></li>
<li><p>If you select your new Storage Account, on the right hand side of the Windows Azure Portal you will see all of the properties for this new Storage Account:<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Storage_Account_Properties.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Storage_Account_Properties_thumb.png" alt="Storage_Account_Properties" />
</a>The main ones of interest are the “Keys”, which we will use later to connect to the Blob Storage Account from WordPress, and the Blob URL. The Blob URL is the publicly routable URL for accessing your Blob Storage account. Any files you upload to the Blob Storage Account will be accessible using this URL as a prefix. As you can see though, this URL is slightly long, and when used in the context of existing website, say gep13.co.uk, it bears no relation to it. However, this is something we can change by applying a Custom Domain to the Storage Account.</p></li>
<li><p>Select your Storage Account, and then press <em>Add Domain</em>, as shown below:<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Add_Custom_Domain.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Add_Custom_Domain_thumb.png" alt="Add_Custom_Domain" /></a></p></li>
<li><p>In the <em>Add a Custom Domain </em>Dialog, enter the domain name that you would like to use for this Storage Account. In my case, I wanted to use cdn.gep13.co.uk:<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Add_Custom_Domain_Name.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Add_Custom_Domain_Name_thumb.png" alt="Add_Custom_Domain_Name" /></a>Press OK.</p></li>
<li><p>At this point, Windows Azure will begin to create the Custom Domain name:<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Custom_Domain_Name_being_created.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Custom_Domain_Name_being_created_thumb.png" alt="Custom_Domain_Name_being_created" /></a></p></li>
<li><p>Once the initial process for the Custom Domain creation has completed, you will then have to validate that the domain name that you want to use actually belongs to you:<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Validate_Custom_Domain_Name.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Validate_Custom_Domain_Name_thumb.png" alt="Validate_Custom_Domain_Name" /></a>In order to do this, you will need to log into your Domain Registrar and alter the DNS Records for your domain to include a new CNAME record. The details for this record are provided for you, as per the above screenshot, so simply enter these details into your Domain Registrar site. As an example, this is what I had to do:<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Add_Verify_Domain_to_Registrar.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Add_Verify_Domain_to_Registrar_thumb.png" alt="Add_Verify_Domain_to_Registrar" /></a>Depending on how your Domain Registrar user interface works, remember to include the “.” at the end of the Canonical name, otherwise the DNS Record will not be accepted. Your new DNS record will take a while to propagate across the internet, so in the meantime, simply close the above <em>Validate Custom Domain</em> window, and you will see that your Custom Domain creation is in a <em>Pending </em>state:<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Custom_Domain_Name_Pending.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Custom_Domain_Name_Pending_thumb.png" alt="Custom_Domain_Name_Pending" /></a></p></li>
</ol>


<p>At this point, you might want to jump to Step 11.</p>

<ol>
<li>Once enough time has passed (I waited a couple of hours) return to the Windows Azure portal and select your domain and click Validate Domain:<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Validate_Custom_Domain_Name_001.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Validate_Custom_Domain_Name_001_thumb.png" alt="Validate_Custom_Domain_Name_001" /></a>If everything worked correctly you will see:<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Domain_validated.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Domain_validated_thumb.png" alt="Domain_validated" /></a>However, depending on how long you waited, you might see this:<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Validation_Failed.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Validation_Failed_thumb.png" alt="Validation_Failed" /></a></li>
</ol>


<p>If you do, don’t worry, this simply means that the DNS Settings haven’t finished propagating, so try again later.</p>

<ol>
<li>The only other thing left to do on this side of things is to create another CNAME record which will do the work of redirecting any requests to your Custom Domain, to your Blob Storage Account. All this means is that you need a CNAME record that has something like the following:<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/CNAME_for_redirect.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/CNAME_for_redirect_thumb.png" alt="CNAME_for_redirect" /></a>This is a redirect from the Custom Domain Name that you created, to the Blob URL for your storage account that was highlighted in Step 5 above. In order to say time, you might want to think about creating this CNAME record at the same time as you create the verify CNAME, that way you won’t have to wait a second lot of propagation time.</li>
</ol>

<h1>configure your Blob Storage Account</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>Now that the Blob Storage Account has been created, and Custom Domain established, we have a little bit of work to do in order to first configure the Blob Storage Account for use. It is easiest to do this using a 3rd Party Tool. There are a couple of main ones out there, the first being from <a href="http://cerebrata.com/">Redgate</a> (who acquired Cerebrata) and you can get a trial version of their software, and also <a href="http://clumsyleaf.com/products/cloudxplorer">CloudXplorer from ClumsyLeaf</a>. For the purposes of this walk through, I will be using CloudXplorer, so go ahead and get that installed.</p></li>
<li><p>Open CloudXplorer and select File | Accounts and the _Manage accounts_window opens:<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Manage_Accounts.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Manage_Accounts_thumb.png" alt="Manage_Accounts" /></a></p></li>
<li><p>Click the New… button and then select Windows Azure Account… and the <em>Windows Azure account </em>window will open:<br/>
<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/New_Windows_Azure_Account.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/New_Windows_Azure_Account_thumb.png" alt="New_Windows_Azure_Account" /></a></p></li>
<li><p>Using the information from step 5 above, enter the details of the Blob Storage Account that we created, where “Secret Key:” equates to the “Primary Access Key” (simply click View button to bring this up) and Name: is the Name of your Blob Storage Account, i.e. in my case gep13wpstorage.
<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Windows_Azure_Account_Window.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Windows_Azure_Account_Window_thumb.png" alt="Windows_Azure_Account_Window" /></a></p></li>
<li><p>With the account in place, the first thing we need to do is to create a container within the Blob Storage Account. This will let us compartmentalise files into the correct location. Right click in the right hand window of CloudXplorer and select New | Container…<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/CloudXplorer_Create_Container.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/CloudXplorer_Create_Container_thumb.png" alt="CloudXplorer_Create_Container" /></a></p></li>
<li><p>In the <em>Create directory/container </em>window, enter the name for your container. I went for “myuploads”.
<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Create_New_Container.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Create_New_Container_thumb.png" alt="Create_New_Container" /></a></p></li>
<li><p>Now we need to set the properties of the container to allow public access. Right click on the container that you just created and select Properties.<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Container_Properties.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Container_Properties_thumb.png" alt="Container_Properties" /></a></p></li>
<li><p>In the myloads Properties window, select the Policies tab and then select &ldquo;<em>Full public read access</em>” in the Access control drop down list, then select ok.<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Container_Policies.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Container_Policies_thumb.png" alt="Container_Policies" /></a></p></li>
</ol>


<h1>configure WordPress</h1>

<p>At this point, you have a number of options to set up your WordPress site to use Windows Azure as it’s repository for static content. Microsoft have actually released their own WordPress plugin which does just that. If you are interested, you can find this <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/windows-azure-storage/">here</a>. I ended up not using this particular plugin. As far as I could see, the onus was on you to manually move the files into your Azure container. Now, this isn’t hard to do, using the CloudXplorer I showed earlier, files can easily be copied into the container, but I wanted something a little more integrated.</p>

<p>I ended up using the excellent W3 Total Cache plugin which you can find <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/w3-total-cache/">here</a>. Again, the complete setup and configuration of this plugin is out with the scope of this particular blog post (I might write another one on this), however, the main thing to know is that there are a number of potential endpoints for this plugin including:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/W3TC_CDN_Options.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/W3TC_CDN_Options_thumb.png" alt="W3TC_CDN_Options" /></a></p>

<p>As you will see, I have chosen Microsoft Azure Storage. From there, you can then specify the options for connecting to Windows Azure:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/CDN_Settings.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/CDN_Settings_thumb.png" alt="CDN_Settings" /></a></p>

<p>Including the Custom Domain name which we set up earlier (if you can remember that far back).</p>

<p>With that in place, you can then use the W3 Total Cache plugin to move all the necessary files into your Blob Storage Account. You can simply click on each of the required buttons:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/General_Settings.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/General_Settings_thumb.png" alt="General_Settings" /></a></p>

<p>Then, with all the files uploaded, and W3 Total Cache activated, it will rewrite all of the URL’s for all of your static content to come from your Blob Storage Account. Feel free to take a look and see this in action by right clicking on the view source of this page, and searching for cdn.gep13.co.uk.</p>

<p>And that, as they say, is that! If you have any questions, please feel free to get in touch.</p>
