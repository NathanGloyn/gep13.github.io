	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/matt-lacey-on-tour-wpug-mrlacey/" itemprop="url">Matt Lacey on Tour</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Back in October of 2011, I dropped an email to Matt Lacey, of the <a href="http://wpug.net/">Windows Phone User Group</a>, asking whether he would be interested in doing a talk up in Scotland at the <a href="http://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/">Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group</a>.  This was a bit of a long shot, but I was always brought up with the saying, “If you don’t ask, you don’t get”, so I thought the worst that he could say would be “No”.</p>

<p>I am thrilled to say that Matt agreed that coming up to Aberdeen would certainly be a possibility, and in fact, he would be interested in doing a tour of the user groups up in Scotland.  Once again, with the help of the <a href="http://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/post/2011/12/10/Scottish-Meetup-Network.aspx">Scottish Meetup Network</a>, I am delighted to say that we have been able to secure Matt to do 3 User Group Sessions.</p>

<p>The schedule for the tour breaks down as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Tuesday 21 February</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.edinburgh.bcs.org/events/2011-12/120221.htm">What and why every developer needs to know about mobile development - BCS Edinburgh and Scottish Developers</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Wednesday 22nd February</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://dwsmattlacey.eventbrite.com/">What and why every developer needs to know about mobile development - Dundee Web Standards</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Thursday 23rd February</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://adnuguk-feb2012.eventbrite.com/?ref=ebtn">Getting started with Windows Phone – Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>This is a very busy schedule, and hopefully you will be able to catch Matt at one of the above events.  I will update the above with links to full details of all the above events as and when they become available.</p>

<p>If you require any additional information about the above tour, please feel free to get in touch.</p>

		<p>A couple of months back, Sebastien Lambla (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/serialseb">@serialseb</a>), the creator of <a href="http://www.openwrap.org/">OpenWrap</a> and <a href="http://openrasta.org/">OpenRasta</a>, emailed the Developer Pro Leader email distribution list asking whether anyone would be interested in hosting his HTTP Caching 101 presentation.  I haven’t had the privilege to see one of Sebastien’s talks, but I have heard that they are very good, and I immediately contacted him to see whether he would be interested in bringing his talk to Scotland.  I am happy to say that he said that he was very interested, however, in order to make the trip worthwhile, it would be good to do a collection of User Groups.  With the help of the <a href="http://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/post/2011/12/10/Scottish-Meetup-Network.aspx">Scottish Meetup Network</a> and <a href="http://www.nxtgenug.net/Default.aspx">NxtGenUG</a> I am delighted to say that we have been able to secure Sebastien to do 5 talks, as well as a Geek Dinner.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>As part of my work goals, I have been compiling a list of UK Developer Conferences/Events that are happening this year, and trying to decide which, if any, I can attend.  Note, I am not saying that this is a complete list of events.  In fact, this is just the opposite.  This is a list of events that I am aware of, and I would like to know about any that I have not listed here, see note at the end of the blog post.  I have not included any Local User Group Events in this list, as that would make for a very long list.  This list is limited to upcoming conferences which are between 1 and 5 days in duration.  If you are interested in finding Local User Group Events, you might want to check out this <a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/page/Scottish-Meetings.aspx">calendar</a> which posts a number of upcoming events.</p>

<p>Once I know exact details for these events, in terms of exact dates, venues, websites, registration, etc, I will be updating this post.  More for the sake of my own sanity, so I don’t have to go digging around to find it again, but hopefully it will prove useful for you as well.  The events appear in “roughly” a chronological order, based on what I do know, but this will likely change around as the dates get confirmed.</p>

	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name"><a href="/blog/wordpress-3-3-1-released/" itemprop="url">WordPress 3.3.1 Released</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Having logged into my Blog this morning, I was informed that a new release of WordPress was available; Version 3.3.1.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2012-01-04_0644.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2012-01-04_0644_thumb.png" alt="2012-01-04_0644" /></a></p>

<p>Upon checking what was included in this <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2012/01/wordpress-3-3-1/">release</a>, it was clear that this was something that I should get installed pretty much straight away, and this is exactly what I did.</p>

<p>With the Database and Files backed up, I hit the Update button, and once again I am happy to say that everything “just worked”. It is good to see that the WordPress Developers are adding a “bit of fun” into the update process:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2012-01-04_0652.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2012-01-04_0652_thumb.png" alt="2012-01-04_0652" /></a></p>

<p>Since this update addresses a Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability, I would highly recommend that everyone using WordPress update their sites immediately.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>2011 was my first year of doing what I would class as “proper” blogging.  I have had a blog for several years now, but it is only recently, with my increased involvement in the community, that I have been doing more blog posts.  I have every intention of continuing this in 2012, and with that in mind, I wanted to capture the stats for my blog in 2011, so that I can compare them next year.</p>

<p>Here are my Google Analytics results:</p>

<p>Highlights being:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>4,482 Visits</p></li>
<li><p>3,018 Unique Visitors</p></li>
<li><p>7,201 Pageviews</p></li>

<li><p>75.46% Bounce Rate</p></li>
<li><p>66.87% % New Visits</p></li>
</ul>


<p>And thanks to the JetPack addin that I use for my WordPress blog, other stats are:</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>It seems like everyone is doing a retrospective blog post about 2011, so I thought that I would jump on the bandwagon.</p>

<p>Here goes…</p>

<p>2011 has been a very busy year for me, both from a work/community and personal standpoint.  What follows is a brief recap of what I have been involved in this year, and also a look ahead at what I hope to be doing in 2012.</p>

<h2>Getting Involved in the Development Community</h2>

<p>Getting involved in the development community was one of my main aims for 2011, and I like to think that I have achieved this.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/">Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group</a> is going from strength to strength, both in terms of the number of registered members, as well as attendance.  With the help of our amazing vendor sponsors, we are able to offer the <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=107">following prizes</a> at each ADNUGUK meeting, and I am hopeful that this will continue into the New Year.  I am already looking to 2012 to get events planned and booked, and I am in a position where the next three events are in the planning stages, and although I can’t say too much yet, there is a HUGE event in the making for our 2 year anniversary in July.  More details will follow on this when I have some more pieces confirmed.</p>

<p>I went out of my way to attend numerous Community Events this year.  Looking at my <a href="http://tweetstats.com/graphs/gep13#tcloud">hashtag cloud</a> from Twitter, it is pretty clear where I went:</p>

<p><a href="http://tweetstats.com/graphs/gep13#tcloud"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image8.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>This year I attended, <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=28">DDD9</a>, <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=210">DDD Scotland</a>, <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=278">DDD South West</a>, <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=377">The Progressive .Net Tutorials</a>, <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=416">GiveCamp UK</a>, and <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=436">DunDDD</a>!  These were all great events, and if I was forced to choose one above all others, it would have to be GiveCamp UK.  The sense of satisfaction that everyone in attendance got from helping out at GiveCamp was amazing, and I would strongly encourage anyone to attend should it happen again in 2012.</p>

<p>Attending events like this is a great way to develop yourself as well as get to know other developers.  As a direct result of these events you can see from this graph the type of characters I have ended up talking to on Twitter throughout 2011:</p>

<p><a href="http://tweetstats.com/graphs/gep13#tcloud"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image9.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>All of the above mentioned people have helped me in 2011, in one way or another, and for this I am very grateful!  Twitter really is a great way to get involved with fellow developers, and it is a wonderful source of information.  If you are a developer, and you are not on Twitter, you should be!</p>

<p>As some of you may know, I am a Moderator of the ASP.Net Forum over at <a href="http://www.vbforums.com/index.php">VBForums</a> (and no, before Paul Stack or Barry Mooring say anything, this isn’t just a forum for Visual Basic), however this year saw me getting a <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=80">promotion to Super Moderator</a>.  As a result, I now have administration rights to all the forums, and am able to help out with moderating and moving threads around, and generally keeping the community there in check.</p>

<p>This year saw me review a couple of articles for the <a href="http://www.developerfusion.com/">developerFusion</a> website, something which I found to be very interesting, and which I hope to continue into 2012.</p>

<h2>From a Personal Stand Point</h2>

<p>I had the pleasure of entering my first <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=30">photography contest</a>, and although I didn’t win anything, it was a lot of fun.  The photos that did win were very <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=94">worthy winners</a>!  I like to “think” that I know how to take photos, but I really don’t.  However, I got a great birthday present this year which was a half day photography lesson, which I am really looking forward to in February next year, and I hope to pick up a few tips.</p>

<p>I did my first “proper” <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=193">User Group presentation</a>.  Going into next year, I am hoping to extend this to some of the larger User Group Events, however, I will have to do a lot of prep work for this, and also extend the areas that I am able to talk on, all of which will take a lot of time and effort, but the rewards should more than make up for this!</p>

<p>I went on an amazing <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=290">4x4 driving experience</a>, which I would thoroughly recommend to anyone!</p>

<p>I installed far too many <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=3">Visual Studio Extensions</a>!  Thankfully, <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=307">ExtensionSync</a> makes it very easy to maintain this across your different computers.</p>

<p>I set up the ability to <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=337">stream High Definition media to our upstairs television</a>.  This ended up being a lot more work than I thought it was going to be, but I am happy to say that the end result works really well!</p>

<p>My inner child was awoken with the purchase of <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=495">LEGO Mindstorms</a>.  If you are looking for the ultimate geek toy, look no further, it is truly amazing!</p>

<p>My wife and I celebrated our first Wedding Anniversary!  If she can continue to put up with me, this will hopefully be the first of many happy years together.</p>

<h2>Looking forward to 2012</h2>

<p>Looking forward into 2012, there will mainly be more of the same as above.  Following <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=313">the principles</a> that I took from Mark Rendle’s talk at DDD South West I will be looking to improve myself as a developer, but I also hope to break into doing talks at some of these community events, rather than simply attending them.  This will be a big step for me, but something that I am very much looking forward to.</p>

<p>I will be continuing to blog next year as well, however, I am looking to writing much more technical blog posts.  I have learnt a lot this year from all the talks that I have attended, and I am looking to implement these technologies in a number of pet projects.  I will be blogging the trials and tribulations that I have along the way, which will hopefully help other people.</p>

<p>And that, as they say, is that!  I hope you all had a great 2011, and here’s to 2012!</p>

<p>Earlier this year I bought “<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0672335522/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0672335522">101 Windows Phone 7 Apps, Volume 1</a>” by Adam Nathan (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/adamnathan">@adamnathan</a>), and I have to say that I absolutely loved it!  Although it can only be described as a tomb, coming in at 1130 pages, it is a great read!  It is delivered in full colour, making it very easy to read, and all the sample code is available for all the applications.  The book starts off slowly, for instance the second application is the dreaded Flashlight application (the Hello World Application for Windows Phone 7) and moves through to more complicated applications like a Jigsaw Puzzle which utilises Drag and Drop features.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0672335603/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0672335603"><img src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.co.uk/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;Format=_SL160_&amp;ASIN=0672335603&amp;MarketPlace=GB&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Thanks to an email this morning from Amazon, I have just pre-ordered the “<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0672335603/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=www6thprimeco-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0672335603">101 Windows Phone 7 Apps, Volume 2</a>” which I am very much looking forward to reading!  I have a few books that I was going to be reading over the Christmas break, but this one will be making it to the top of the pile.</p>

<p>The only thing that I would say is, and this is directed at Sams Publishing rather than Adam, it would be great if they could offer deals similar to <a href="http://www.apress.com/">Apress</a> and <a href="http://oreilly.com/">O’Reilly</a> where having bought the print book, you can then purchase a companion digital version of the book for a reduced price, rather than paying full price for it again!  This would be especially useful for books of this size as it would mean that you could search the book on your computer when looking for something particular.</p>

<p>As some of you may remember, I recently <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=499">blogged</a> about the fact that I was missing some applications from my collection of Windows Phone 7 Apps. i.e. there were letters in my Windows Phone 7 Jump List that didn’t have any applications behind them.</p>

<p>With the help of some fellow Windows Phone 7 owners, I have now been able to complete the set (with the exception of the Globe icon in the bottom right hand corner. I am led to believe that this icon is for <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1204578">handling foreign languages</a>, which I don’t have on my phone).</p>

<p>I will be updating the <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=305">complete list</a> of applications that I have installed in the next couple of days, but for now, the applications that completed the collection were:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Jingle Balls</p></li>
<li><p>Kayak</p></li>
<li><p>Quick Reader</p></li>
<li><p>VLC Play</p></li>
<li><p>XDA Wallpaper</p></li>
