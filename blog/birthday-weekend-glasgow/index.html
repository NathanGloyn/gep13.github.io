	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>This weekend was my birthday, and Lynn and myself spent the weekend together with a number of different activities.</p>

<p>The first was Clubland on Friday night at the Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Centre. To say I felt a little bit old at the event would be a little bit of an understatement. The event was full of lot of young people wearing very little clothes!!! I think there is going to be a major flu epidemic hitting Aberdeen in the next few days. Have to say though, I had quite a good time, didn&rsquo;t know many of the songs, or the artists, but it was good. You can see the pictures below:</p>

<p>We then went down to Glasgow to spend the weekend. We took the Mega Bus down rather than the train this time, but that was fine. We stayed in the same Holiday Inn by Express that we stayed in last time. Once we arrived we went for a meal at Di Maggio&rsquo;s, it was really nice!!! Then we took a taxi to The Saw Doctors concert at The Barrow Lands. I had a really good time, they put on a really good show!! I picked up a new t-shirt and the new CD, which I am looking forward to listening too. You can see the photos from the concert below:</p>

<p>Sunday was spent doing some shopping, and then we went to see the new Angelina Jolie film, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0824747/">Changeling</a>. It was quite a sad story, but it was a really good watch.</p>

<p>In the evening we went to the <a href="http://www.jongleurs.com/">Jongleurs</a> comedy club. We got a table for two right at the front of the stage, we were a little concerned that we were going to get picked on, but we didn&rsquo;t. The three comics that were there were very funny, and I would fully recommend going along. There was one annoying girl in the crowd who thought she was funny, and was continually trying to heckle the comics, but she ended up coming across very annoying!! Towards the end I think she got the idea, and stopped heckling.</p>

<p>We came back up the road on the Mega Bus again on Monday afternoon, after having a great weekend.</p>
