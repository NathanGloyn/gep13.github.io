    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>tl;dr</h1>

<p>Really nice keyboard, and would definitely recommend!</p>

<h1>Getting started with my new Sculpt Keyboard</h1>

<p><strong>Full Disclaimer:</strong> I have only been using this keyboard for about 2 hours. The opinions shared here may change over time, and if they do, I will update the blog post to reflect this.</p>

<p>For over five years now, I have been the proud owner of the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000. I liked this keyboard so much that I actually bought two of them. One for the office, and one for home. However, as with most things, there comes a time when items need to be replaced. For me, with this particular keyboard, this was mainly due to the fact that on my work version, the “y” key had become flaky. Every so often, even though it was definitely being pushed, it simply wouldn’t work. The &ldquo;solution&rdquo; was to hit the key really hard, and it would eventually work. When I decided to leave my old job, I also decided it was time to replace the keyboard, and have a new one for my new job. New beginnings and all that…</p>

<p>When I was given some Amazon vouchers as part of my leaving present, I thought that this would be the perfect opportunity to get the new keyboard, and so I bought <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-gb/p/sculpt-ergonomic-desktop/L5V-00006">this</a>.</p>

<p>I have since had this delivered, and I am in fact using it to write this blog post. What are my thoughts so far I hear you ask? Well, let me tell you…</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>The Keyboard</h2>

<p>I really like it! It is much smaller than the 4000, but this is mainly due to the keys that it doesn’t have, i.e. the NumPad. You can see the Sculpt Keyboard sitting on top of the 4000 in the picture below:</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_2227&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;584&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/old-new-sculpt-ergonomic/wp_20140607_19_36_45_pro/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/WP_20140607_19_36_45_Pro-1024x576.jpg" alt="Sculpt sitting on top of 4000" /></a> Sculpt sitting on top of 4000[/caption]</p>

<p>The keyboard itself feels very solid, which is good. Access to the battery compartment is via a magnetised cover (all the devices, keyboard, mouse and Number Pad, all share this feature), which makes inserting/changing the batteries very simple. The keys feel much less mechanical than the 4000, which was a common complaint of that device, and they don’t take as much movement of the fingers to depress the keys. It actually feels more like typing on a laptop keyboard, but with the benefit of the split keyboard layout</p>

<p>With the aid of a toggle switch, each function key can be used as a shortcut for Windows 8 functions, such as Search, Share, Settings, etc. This isn’t something that I think I will be making use of. I will keep it in Function Key mode, and simply use keyboard shortcuts like &ldquo;Windows+C&rdquo; to get to the required functionality.</p>

<p>Initially, the split space bar seemed a little to me, however, having used it, this makes sense. I typically hit the space bar with my right thumb, and I am finding it much easier to press, as you are not having to depress a much larger key.</p>

<h2>The Mouse</h2>

<p>When I took the mouse out of the box, my immediate reaction was, euch! What is that bulbous, monstrosity!</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_2224&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;584&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/old-new-sculpt-ergonomic/wp_20140607_19_35_44_pro/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/WP_20140607_19_35_44_Pro-1024x576.jpg" alt="Microsoft Sculpt Mouse" /></a> Microsoft Sculpt Mouse[/caption]</p>

<p>However, having used it for a while, I am actually getting used to it, and I think I will like it. The addition of the Windows key, to take you to the Start Screen is a nice touch, and the back button (which I have come to rely on with my mice) is a very welcome addition.</p>

<h2>The Number Pad</h2>

<p>What can I say, it’s a Number Pad.</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_2225&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;576&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/old-new-sculpt-ergonomic/wp_20140607_19_35_56_pro/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/WP_20140607_19_35_56_Pro-576x1024.jpg" alt="Microsoft Sculpt Number Pad" /></a> Microsoft Sculpt Number Pad[/caption]</p>

<p>It does exactly what it says on the tin. While using the trio of devices, I have found myself looking for the Number Pad directly to the right of the keyboard (when entering an IP address, for instance) and it hasn’t been there. I think that will take a minute to get used to, but on the whole, the Number Pad is not a common input mechanism for me, so I don’t think I will mind having to move further to find it when required.</p>

<h2>The Transceiver</h2>

<p>This to me seems quite big, I would have expected it to be smaller, similar to that of my Fitbit or Garmin connector, shown below:</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_2228&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;584&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/old-new-sculpt-ergonomic/wp_20140607_19_37_52_pro/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/WP_20140607_19_37_52_Pro-1024x576.jpg" alt="Sculpt Transceiver compared to Garmin one" /></a> Sculpt Transceiver compared to Garmin one[/caption]</p>

<p>The only thing I can think is that it needs to be larger due to the fact that it is a single transceiver for all three devices. When not required, or being transported, there is a slot in the inside of the mouse for storing it. Again, this is a magnetized slot, so immediately when stored, it feels secure.</p>

<p>One word of warning though:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ijonas/status/463983735365697536">https://twitter.com/ijonas/status/463983735365697536</a></p>

<h2>The setup</h2>

<p>This really was a snap! Took everything out of the box, removed the battery savings strips, plugged in the transceiver, small driver install, and everything worked. I am running Windows 8.1.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Continuous Integration 101</h1>

<p>On Saturday 23rd November 2013, I presented a talk entitled &ldquo;Continuous Integration 101&rdquo; at the <a href="http://dun.dddscotland.com/">DunDDD Conference in Dundee</a>.  The abstract for the talk was as follows:</p>

<blockquote>It is well understood that &#8220;Continuous Integration&#8221; is a development best practice, however, it is also something that is not often implemented within development teams. Typical reasons include:

- It is difficult to set up
- It is difficult to maintain
- It takes too long

In this session we will look at how you can incrementally work your way to fully implementing Continuous Integration into your development process. This talk will focus on using TeamCity as the Continuous Integration Server and psake build engine.</blockquote>


<p>Overall, I was quite happy with how the talk went, and it seems to go down quite well.  There was a fair bit of interaction with the audience, with several questions, which I hope that I was able to answer.  If there are any follow-up questions, then please feel free to get in touch, and I will do my best to respond.</p>

<h1>slides and code</h1>

<p>If you are interested in seeing the slides from the talk, you can find them displayed below, and also available as a download link on this post.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>But there is a fix&hellip;</h1>

<p>Following the update of my laptop to Windows 8.1, every time I would tether to my Windows Phone 8 using Internet Connection Sharing, I would get a Blue Screen Of Death (BSOD).</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_2182&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;584&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/bsod-windows-8.1-using-internet-connection-sharing-windows-phone-8/wp_20131025_07_11_25_pro/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/WP_20131025_07_11_25_Pro-1024x576.jpg" alt="BSOD when using ICS 1" /></a> BSOD when using ICS 1[/caption]</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_2181&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;584&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/bsod-windows-8.1-using-internet-connection-sharing-windows-phone-8/wp_20131025_06_56_38_pro/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/WP_20131025_06_56_38_Pro-1024x576.jpg" alt="BSOD when using ICS 2" /></a> BSOD when using ICS 2[/caption]</p>

<p>This wouldn&rsquo;t happen if I was connected to a standard wireless connection, it was only when I was using the wireless hot spot which is made available through Internet Connection Sharing on my Windows Phone 8.  After a bit of googling, I turned up this post:</p>

<p><a href="http://gadgets.itwriting.com/1986-fixing-blue-screen-using-internet-connection-sharing-in-windows-phone-8.html#comment-35511">http://gadgets.itwriting.com/1986-fixing-blue-screen-using-internet-connection-sharing-in-windows-phone-8.html#comment-35511</a></p>

<p>Which seemed to explain exactly what I needed to do, however, for the life of me, I couldn&rsquo;t find the dialogue box in Windows 8.1 that would give me access to the FIPS setting to fix the issue.  I asked the author of the blog post if he could help, and happily he was able to, check the comments of the blog post from that information on that.</p>

<p>However, while I was waiting for his reply, I reached out to my friendly neighborhood IT expert, namely <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkLeHuray">Mark Le Huray</a>, who was able to point me in the direction of a command line way of setting the required parameter:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/MarkLeHuray/status/393664176012267520">https://twitter.com/MarkLeHuray/status/393664176012267520</a></p>

<p>Here &ldquo;ur wireless name&rdquo; is actually the name of the wireless endpoint, i.e. the SSID for the connection.  This is what is displayed in the Internet Sharing page on your windows phone.</p>

<p>Opening the command prompt, and executing this command was all the is required to get rid of the BSOD:</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_2183&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;677&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/bsod-windows-8.1-using-internet-connection-sharing-windows-phone-8/2013-11-05_0741/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013-11-05_0741.png" alt="Fixing BSOD by setting FIPS" /></a> Fixing BSOD by setting FIPS[/caption]</p>

<p>Big thanks to Mark for all his help in getting this sorted, and also Tim who pointed me in the right direction!</p>

    <link href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/battery-life-nokia-lumia-920-really-fantastic/"/>
    <updated>2013-10-28T19:47:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/battery-life-nokia-lumia-920-really-fantastic</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>&hellip;when you turn off all data connections!</h1>

<h1>tl;dr;</h1>

<p>With all the radios and antennas switched off on my Nokia Lumia 920, the battery has lasted from the 28th October through to today, the 7th November.  A total of 11 days!  This has included some fairly solid use, listening to podcasts, audio books and music, as well as using it as my alarm clock.  This is far more than I thought it would last, very impressed.  See the gallery at the end of the post for pictures of how the battery was discharging.  The spikes are when I was syncing the phone with the desktop to grab some new podcasts.</p>

<h1>Now the full story&hellip;</h1>

<p>I recently did a <a href="http://gep13.me/1gbHdfP">blog post</a> about how I started using my old Nokia Lumia 920 as my alternative to both a TomTom and an iPod.  Apart from a couple synchronisation issues between iTunes and the Windows Phone Desktop Application, I am happy to report that this little experiment has been going really well.  I use the phone pretty much every day, listening to podcasts on the commute to work, and music while in the office, and also taking photos/videos of Alivia (that&rsquo;s our new-born baby daughter :-)).</p>

<p>The one thing that has <em>really </em>stood out for me though is the battery life of the Nokia Lumia 920.  As soon as you turn on flight mode, i.e. disabling all the data connections that the phone has to offer (Bluetooth, wi-fi, mobile, etc), the battery quite literally goes for days!  When using my Nokia Lumia 925 as a <em>phone, </em>I am lucky if I can go a day without needing to charge it again.</p>

<p>Today I charged the 920 for what I think is the first time since I made the switch to using this device as my media device, although I think I must have charged it in between, otherwise it would have been over 2 weeks without a charge, which would be a bit of a stretch I think.</p>

<p>Using the <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-gb/store/app/insider/d9b7989e-1592-4f25-a556-4755c06bf2e9">Insider</a> application, it is currently estimating 6 days and 4 hours before the next charge for the Nokia Lumia 920, and 1 day and 2 hours for the Nokia Lumia 925.  See the screenshots below:</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_2162&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignleft&rdquo; width=&ldquo;180&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/battery-life-nokia-lumia-920-really-fantastic.../wp_ss_20131028_0001/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/wp_ss_20131028_0001-180x300.jpg" alt="Insider Application running on Nokia Lumia 925" /></a> Insider Application running on Nokia Lumia 925[/caption]</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_2163&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignright&rdquo; width=&ldquo;180&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/battery-life-nokia-lumia-920-really-fantastic.../wp_ss_20131028_0001-2/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/wp_ss_20131028_0001-180x300.png" alt="Insider Application running on Nokia Lumia 920" /></a> Insider Application running on Nokia Lumia 920[/caption]</p>

<p>I firmly believe that the Nokia Lumia 925 will need charged tomorrow morning, but I am very curious to see how the Nokia Lumia 920 lasts before needing another charge.</p>

<p>In addition, here is a gallery of how the battery was discharging through the 11 days that it was being used.  Very impressive!</p>

    <id>http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/started-using-nokia-lumia-920-ipod-tomtom-replacement</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>And I can&rsquo;t see myself looking back!</h1>

<p>I am now using my spare Nokia Lumia 920 as a replacement for both my failing Classic iPod, and my TomTom.  I have always liked to keep music and GPS devices separate from my phone, as using these types of services is a big drain on battery.  Now though, I am using two phone devices to service all of these needs.  No more need to carry around 3 separate devices!</p>

<h1>Here&rsquo;s the story&hellip;</h1>

<p>I recently upgraded my mobile phone to the Nokia Lumia 925, and I love it!  I upgraded from the Nokia Lumia 920, but there were a couple of things happening with the 920 which made me want to move away from it.  The first of which was that a single pixel, all the way down the screen, is stuck on a single colour.  This started happening after the warranty ran out on it, so there was nothing I could do aside from an expensive repair.  I opted to reset the device in order to send it to something like Mazuma mobile to get some money for it, however, the reset didn&rsquo;t go well and it got stuck on the spinning gears.  Doh!</p>

<p>For the last few months, the 920 has been nothing more than a paper weight on my desk, but after a Twitter conversation the other day, I was pointed at the following <a href="http://mobileworld.appamundi.com/blogs/petevickers/archive/2013/09/13/what-do-i-do-if-my-lumia-shows-spinning-gears-and-won-t-restart.aspx">blog post</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/petevick">Pete Vickers</a>.  Now, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I was skeptical.  The key combination sounded like something from a Street Fighter Special Move, but I gave it a shot.  After 3 attempts, the 920 rebooted, and after a period of time, I was booted into the main screen. Result!</p>

<p>I then went ahead and grabbed the latest update for the phone, taking the phone up to the GDR 2 release, and then went ahead and installed all the necessary applications, including the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-gb/store/app/here-drive/31bbc68c-503e-4561-8d85-a294d54df06f">HERE Drive+</a> - Navigation application (uses the HERE Maps application)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-gb/store/app/here-maps/efa4b4a7-7499-46ce-aa95-3e4ab3b39313">HERE Maps </a>-  Mapping application that allows for downloading maps using a WiFi Connection, and then using locally on device</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-gb/store/app/here-transit/adfdad16-b54a-4ec3-b11e-66bd691be4e6">HERE Transit</a> - Provides routes between two selected places</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-gb/store/app/nokia-music/f5874252-1f04-4c3f-a335-4fa3b7b85329">Nokia Music</a> - free music streaming application (also plays local music files)</p></li>
<li><p>Nokia Pro Cam - quite simply amazing!</p></li>
<li><p>Nokia Smart Cam - great camera application</p></li>
</ul>


<p>With these applications in place, and my music and podcasts synced to the phone and required maps downloaded, I have a perfectly functioning iPod and TomTom replacement, taking the number of devices that I need to carry around from 2, to 3.</p>

<p>Although I was in a unique position where I had a spare Nokia Lumia 920 to serve this purpose, there is nothing to stop you doing something similar using one of the many cheap, lower end devices, that are coming onto the market.</p>

<h1>Amazing deal at Tesco on the Nokia Lumia 510</h1>

<p>Last night while shopping at Tesco, I saw the following deal:</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_2146&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;1632&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/started-using-nokia-lumia-920-ipod-tomtom-replacement/wp_20131012_18_47_32_pro/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/WP_20131012_18_47_32_Pro.jpg" alt="Nokia Lumia 510 only £80" /></a> Nokia Lumia 510 only £80[/caption]</p>

<p>This is quite simply amazing!  When you put it together with the services that you get from both Microsoft and Nokia, this little device makes for a compelling choice.  It is not hard to understand why these lower end Lumia&rsquo;s are the fastest selling devices at the moment.  They are very affordable, and offer the end-user a lot of options.</p>

<p>When you compare the above to something like the iPod, starting at £199, it would seem an obvious choice.  The functionality and available applications is comparable.  The Nokia Lumia 510 only has 4GB of hard drive space compared to the 16GB of the iPod, but if you don&rsquo;t need a lot of storage space, or are happy to use the free 7GB of cloud storage, or stream data from the free Nokia Music service, then this is not really a problem.  You could also look to something like the Nokia Lumia 520, which has an option for an expandable micro SD card up to 64GB.</p>

<h1>The setup of the Nokia Lumia 920</h1>

<p>The start screen of my Nokia Lumia 920 now looks like the following:</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_2147&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;768&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/started-using-nokia-lumia-920-ipod-tomtom-replacement/wp_ss_20131013_0001/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/wp_ss_20131013_0001.jpg" alt="Nokia Lumia 920 Start Screen" /></a> Nokia Lumia 920 Start Screen[/caption]</p>

<p>As you can see, all the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; tiles, such as messaging, phone, email, etc, have all been removed, leaving only the tiles for the essential applications, such as navigation and music.  Since all the required maps for the navigation application that Nokia provide can be downloaded ahead of time using the phone&rsquo;s wireless connection, there is no need for a network connection while using it.  In fact, I have actually went as far as to enable the phones flight mode, and will only enable the wireless connection when required.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Get your tickets now!</h1>

<p>I wanted to let you know about an upcoming event in Aberdeen that I have been helping to arrange. It is taking place on Friday 18th October 2013.  The event in question is the Northern Lights 2013 Conference.  The website for the conference can be found here:</p>

<p><a href="http://northernlightsconf.co.uk/">http://northernlightsconf.co.uk/</a></p>

<p>The event is in its third year, and this year the theme is tools.  Both the tools that we use, and the tools we build.  There is a wide range of speakers available, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://northernlightsconf.co.uk/speakers/2013/09/23/hadi-hariri.html">Hadi Hariri</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://northernlightsconf.co.uk/speakers/2013/09/23/kendall-miller.html">Kendall Miller</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://northernlightsconf.co.uk/speakers/2013/09/24/sarah-drummond.html">Sarah Drummond</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://northernlightsconf.co.uk/speakers/2013/09/23/kate-stone.html">Kate Stone</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://northernlightsconf.co.uk/speakers/2013/10/02/maria-gutierrez.html">Maria Gutierrez</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://northernlightsconf.co.uk/speakers/2013/09/23/glenn-henriksen.html">Glenn Hendrickson</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>Who are offering up an exciting line up of talks.</p>

<p>In addition, there will be two open spaces at the conference, where attendees will have an opportunity to suggest a topic for an interactive conversation with other attendees and speakers.  If you haven’t been to an open space before, they are fantastic.  It is a perfect opportunity to interact with other like mind people about a topic that you are interested in.  The best way to get something out of this is to suggest a topic that you are especially interested in, and hopefully other people will get involved as well.</p>

<p>Tickets are £15 for the day, which includes coffee and lunch for regular attendees, and Students tickets to the talks are free, plus you can buy a lunch ticket for £5.</p>

<p>We hope to see you there.  If you have any questions about the event, then please don’t hesitate to get in touch with me.</p>

<p>If you know anyone else who would be interested in attending this event, I would really appreciate it if you could forward on this email.</p>

<p>This event is lovingly sponsored by:</p>

    <id>http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/windows-phone-8-gdr2-update-finally-arrives-nokia-lumia-925-3-network</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am happy to report that the GDR2 update for my Nokia Lumia 925 has finally arrived.  I say finally because it is almost 1 month after it arrived for my wife&rsquo;s phone!  We are not on the same operator, so this is obviously showing the difference in turning around the updates for the Windows Phone eco-system, and it has to be said that this really is a sad state of affairs!  I really hope that this turn around time for pushing out the updates improves, as getting the latest features for my handset is very important to me.  Almost important enough to consider switching mobile phone providers.</p>

<p>Almost 1 month ago, I convinced my wife that she should upgrade her mobile phone to the Nokia Lumia 925.  To my annoyance, one day after receiving the handset, she was prompted that there was an update available for the phone.  I started the update process, which actually consisted of two back to back updates, and after checking, this update was the much rumored <a href="http://winsupersite.com/windows-phone/complete-guide-windows-phone-8-gdr2">GDR2 update</a>.</p>

<p>Following the update, the various version numbers changed as follows:</p>

<table >
<tbody >
<tr >

<td >
</td>

<td >**Original**
</td>

<td >**First Update**
</td>

<td >**Second Update**

<td >**Chip SOC version:**

<td >8960

<td >8960

<td >8960

</tbody>

<p>Fast forward 1 month, and after a twitter conversation with the support team at 3, which was a little coincidental (by the way, I am not claiming responsibility for getting the update released :-)), the GDR2 update arrived for my phone:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/gep13/status/384990097176657922">https://twitter.com/gep13/status/384990097176657922</a></p>

<p>One interesting thing is that although the OS version between the two phones is the same, the firmware version numbers are different.  You can see the comparison table between the original and update on my phone below.  Both the firmware revision number, and the radio software version numbers on my phone are higher than on my wife&rsquo;s phone.</p>

<table >
<tbody >
<tr >

<td >

</tbody>
</table>


<p>To summarize, in addition to the huge difference in time between pushing out the updates between the mobile phone providers, it also looks like they are choosing to release different updates.  It would be really interesting to find out why they are doing this.  To me, this seem a little bit troubling.  I know the carriers have a right to decide which updates are released to the handsets that they are in charge of, but to go an entire month after one of your competitors releases the update seems very excessive to me.  Let&rsquo;s hope the release process improves with the forthcoming GDR3 update.</p>

<p>You can see a gallery of the screenshots that I took during the update process below.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Open and edit a .ai file using Expression Design</h1>

<p>The other week, I needed to edit the original source files for the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group in order to change the size of the png&rsquo;s that I use for various things (like avatar&rsquo;s, etc).  Unfortunately, these were created using Adobe Illustrator, which I don&rsquo;t have access to.  I had a hunt around, but I couldn&rsquo;t find a way to do it.  Enter Twitter&hellip;</p>

<p>The ever knowledgeable Scott Lovegrove (<a href="https://twitter.com/scottisafool">@scottisafool</a>), made a great suggestion of using Expression Design to open and edit the files.  I had thought that Expression Design was only part of the Expression Studio, which I also don&rsquo;t have, but&hellip;</p>

<h1>Expression Design is free!</h1>

<p>Although it used to only be part of the Expression Studio, Express Design is now actually free!  You can download it from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36180">here</a>.</p>

<h1>Opening and Editing the file</h1>

<p>This couldn&rsquo;t be simpler!  Open up Expression Design, and open the file.  Once open, you will have the option to Export the image:</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_2076&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;1171&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Expression-Design-Export-Menu.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Expression-Design-Export-Menu.png" alt="Expression Design Export Menu" /></a> Expression Design Export Menu[/caption]</p>

<p>On the next window, you will then be able to choose the output format, and also the size of the resulting image:</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_2077&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;1206&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Expression-Design-Export-Options.png"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Expression-Design-Export-Options.png" alt="Expression Design Export Options" /></a> Expression Design Export Options[/caption]</p>

<p>Simples!  Thanks again Scott!</p>

    <updated>2013-04-26T22:24:43+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/how-to-keep-chocolatey-pull-request-tidy-and-up-to-date</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>My adventures in updating my Chocolatey Pull Request</h1>

<p>About 3 months ago, I submitted a <a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/238">pull request</a> to the <a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey">Chocolatey Project</a>.  This was a reasonably simple addition, which added a helper method within Chocolatey which allowed the creation of a generic shortcut anywhere that the user required.  As time passed, other commits were made into the Chocolatey Master branch, and my pull-request had become &ldquo;dated&rdquo;.  In addition, in hindsight, I had created 6 commits, for something that could have really been done as a single commit.</p>

<p>Last week, Chocolatey contributor Rich Siegel (<a href="https://twitter.com/rismoney">@rismoney</a>), suggested that I should rebase my pull-request against the latest in the master branch, and also to &ldquo;tidy&rdquo; up the multiple commits into a single commit.  The reason to do this was really two-fold:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>rebasing against the master branch would mean that merging would be simpler</p></li>
<li><p>making it one commit would mean that the commit history would be cleaner, and if any bugs were introduced as a result of the pull-request(s) it would be easier to find this in the history</p></li>
</ul>


<p>My immediate response was, &ldquo;I would love to do this, but how the hell do I do that?!?&rdquo;.  Thankfully, Rich was able to spell it out in terms that even I was able to understand!  So that I can refer back to this in the future, I decided to capture the details in this blog post.</p>

<h1>Where we were&hellip;</h1>

<p>This was the situation that I was in:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I had taken a fork of the Chocolatey code into a new repo</p></li>
<li><p>I had created a branch called Issue-235 which is where my commits had been added</p></li>
<li><p>By branch was behind chocolatey/master by a few commits</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>Where we wanted to get to&hellip;</h1>

<p>Where we were trying to get to was:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>My branch brought up to the latest code that was in master</p></li>
<li><p>Rewrite commit history by reducing all commits (I had 6) into just one</p></li>
<li><p>Update single commit comment to include all details</p></li>
<li><p>Update pull request</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>What was required</h1>

<p>The following gist contains all the commands that were executed:</p>

<p>The final part of what was desired, i.e. updating the pull-request with the changes, haven&rsquo;t <em>automagically</em>.  Thinking about it, this makes sense.  Your pull request is &ldquo;linked&rdquo; to the commits in your forked branch.  When this changes, the pull request is also updated.</p>

<p>I have to say a big thanks to Rich for all his help on this.  I learnt a lot by doing this!</p>

<h1>Should Contributors keep their pull requests up to date?</h1>

<p>Within the discussion of this pull-request, Chocolatey creator Rob Reynolds (<a href="https://twitter.com/ferventcoder">@ferventcoder</a>) suggested that it wasn&rsquo;t the responsibility of the creator of the pull request to keep it &ldquo;up-to-date&rdquo;, but rather for the project coordinators to either accept or reject the pull request quickly enough that keeping it up-to-date would not be required.  Personally, I think that this would be the &ldquo;ideal&rdquo;, but that we don&rsquo;t live in an ideal world.  Time constraints always mean that things don&rsquo;t happen as quickly as we would like, and as a result, we, as the community, should do what we can to help out.</p>

    <id>http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/upgrading-the-ram-of-my-synology-ds1512</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Increasing my Synology DS1512+ RAM to 3GB</h1>

<p>I have to say, I love my <a href="http://www.synology.com/products/product.php?product_name=DS1512%2B">Synology DS1512+</a>!  Out of the box, it comes with 1GB of RAM, which, if you are solely doing file sharing, is more than enough.  However, over the last couple months, I have started doing more and more with my Synology Server:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Hosting Web Sites</p></li>
<li><p>Running a Plex Media Server</p></li>
<li><p>Backing up to the Cloud using CrashPlan</p></li>
</ul>


<p>As a result, I have noticed that certain things are taking longer than they &ldquo;should&rdquo;.  I decided that I wanted to increase the amount of RAM that is in the device.  Digging around the <a href="http://forum.synology.com/enu/">Synology Forums</a> it was clear that this is possible (with some people reporting that they were able to get 4GB to be recognised), it is just a case of deciding what RAM to go for.</p>

<p>I opted to go for <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0050X1OQ6/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">this from Amazon</a>, and I am happy to report that it all worked perfectly!  After installing, the RAM was immediately detected, and the Synology Server is running very smoothly.  Definitely recommend the upgrade to anyone who has not yet done it.  Very cheap to do, with a marked improvement in performance.</p>

    <link href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/review-of-devopsdays-london-2013/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-16T22:06:24+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/review-of-devopsdays-london-2013</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>DevOpsDays has now finished, but had a great time&hellip;</h1>

<p>In a change to the normal Developer Conferences that I attend, I have just finished up at the <a href="http://devopsdays.org/">DevOpsDays </a>London Conference.  More and more I have hearing about how you can better improve the deployment of applications and software by closely combining both the Developer and Operations teams.  This is a relatively new idea to me, and I was very interested to hear, from people who have done this, what can be achieved!</p>

<p>This was a very &ldquo;different&rdquo; conference to what I have attended in the past, but in this case, &ldquo;different&rdquo; is a good thing!  The format was similar, in the sense that there were prepared session on each morning from various speakers, but each afternoon was given over to Open Spaces (more on this below).  I had never been to an Open Space session before, and I was very intrigued.  Turns out they are a GREAT way to learn!  In addition, just before lunch time, there were a series of Ingite talks (again, more on these below).</p>

<p>Overall, I got a lot from this conference.  After two days of hearing what can be done in terms of Configuration Management, Automated Deployments, Team Collaboration, my mind is buzzing with how some of these principles can be taken back to the office.  As to how many we will be able to implement, that is another question, but the fact that I now know that some of them exist, is half the battle!</p>

<p>What follows are some rough notes taken across the duration of the two days.</p>

<h1>Prepared Sessions</h1>

<p>In total, across the two days, there were seven prepared sessions.  Details on these can be seen below:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Niek Bartholomeus</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>&ldquo;DevOps for Dinosaurs&rdquo;</em></p></li>
<li><p>This was a really great introduction to what DevOps is, and what it is trying to achieve.  The talk centered around the work that Niek had done in a company that he worked at to bring DevOps processed into being.  It was really great to hear the experiences from someone who had been through the process.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/niekbartho/devops-for-dinosaurs">Slides</a></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>John Clapham</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>&ldquo;Checking DevOps Vital Signs&rdquo;</em></p></li>
<li><p>In this talk, John explained how in applying DevOps to his organisation, they attempted to garner some metrics so that they could accurately &ldquo;measure&rdquo; how it was helping.  This is a big stumbling block for DevOps.  i.e. how do you prove that the system is working, and actually providing value.  They chose to do this by measuring several vital signs (Cycle Time, Shared Purpose, Motivation, Collaboration, Effectiveness).  The first is reasonably simple to measure, but the others not so much.  They opted to collect this information in the form of a questionnaire.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>David Mytton</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>&ldquo;StartOps: Growing an Ops Team from 1 founder&rdquo;</em></p></li>
<li><p>Again, another interesting session, where David explained the decisions that he had taken in establishing his business.  He was in a position where he had to be pragmatic in adopting the tools and processes that he did.  As the company grew, he was able to adopt different tools and services, to ensure that the company was heading in the right direction.</p></li>
<li><p>Slides will appear <a href="http://blog.serverdensity.com/">here</a></p></li>
<li><p>Some interesting posts <a href="http://www.serverdensity.com/devopsdays/">here</a></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Deri Jones</p>

<ul>
<li><em>&ldquo;Adding Business Metrics&rdquo;</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Thomas Falkenberg and Nils Probson</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>&ldquo;DevOps and the traditional Enterprise IT&rdquo;</em></p></li>
<li><p>A very open, and honest, discussion of how the team at Payback had slowly, over the period of two years, implemented a culture of DevOps.  They found that they are now in a position where Dev and Ops teams have common goals.  However, this can only be achieved by:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Working together</p></li>
<li><p>One step at a time</p></li>
<li><p>Change takes time and patience</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>An important takeaway from this talk &ldquo;The term DevOps helped form a common language, a mantra.  i.e. if the business has a problem, then the company, both the Dev and Ops, need to work together to fix the issue</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Sam Eaton</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>&ldquo;DevOps and the hell of a Thousand Different Platforms&rdquo;</em></p></li>
<li><p>This was an amazing talk!  Sam is clearly enthusiastic about this topic, and this flowed through in his talk.  I later found out that this was his first public talk, which certainly didn&rsquo;t show!  He had some very interesting ideas, the best of which was the &ldquo;FailCake&rdquo;.  Basically, in collaborating between Dev and Ops, it is &ldquo;ok&rdquo; to make mistakes, but these have to be discussed immediately within the team, without associating blame.  They best way they have found to do this is by bringing cake to the meetings!</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Gene Kim</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&ldquo;How can we better sell DevOps&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>This was a VERY inspiring session.  Gene Kim, an author of the hugely popular &ldquo;The Phoenix Project&rdquo; book, explained how to best sell DevOps within the enterprise.  I would highly encourage you to take a look at the slides linked below as they explain, in detail, the barriers that exist Dev and Ops team, and how they are perceived from either side.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/realgenekim/how-can-we-better-sell-devops/">Slides</a></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h1>Open Spaces</h1>

<p>For me, this was the stand out part of the conference.  I had never been to an Open Space before this conference, but I will definitely be looking to attend others.  I am also going to suggest that this is something that we should be looking to include within DDD events.</p>

<p>The format is reasonably simple.  Anyone can suggest a topic to be discussed in an Open Space.  This can be asking for an answer to a question.  Providing a demonstration of a piece of software, or technology.  Pretty much anything.</p>

<p>With the sessions proposed, these are then organised &ldquo;roughly&rdquo; into order, and people &ldquo;vote&rdquo; with their feet, and go to the sessions that interest them.  This then takes the form of an open discussion, where anyone is free to talk, ask questions, and provide input.</p>

<p>We were told that Open Spaces follow three main principles:</p>

<pre><code>* Whenever it starts is the right time


* Whatever happens is the only thing that could have


* It's over when it's over
</code></pre>

<p>All I can say is&hellip;</p>

<p>Amazing!  I got so much out of these sessions.  So many snippets of information, and suggestions.</p>

<h1>Ignites</h1>

<p>Before attending DevOpsDays, I hadn&rsquo;t heard of Ignites.  Turns out this form of talks (which were held on both days just before lunch time) are similar to the 20 x 20 talks that I have seen at DDD events.  Basically, there are a set number of slides, each of which are timed to automatically transition to the next slide.  The speaker has to keep up with each transition, as they can&rsquo;t go back to a previous slide.  Topics here ranged from a custom-built tool for automatic deployments to being conscious of the server farms that you are using and their carbon footprint.</p>

<p>Well done to everyone who was brave enough to do one of these Ignites, I still think the format is very difficult, and I wouldn&rsquo;t like to do one myself.</p>

<p>Some of the slides that I am aware of from these Ignites can be found here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jedi4ever/what-ifconfigmgtwasdesignedbygamers">What If Config Management - Patrick Debois</a></li>
</ul>


<h1>Recommendations</h1>

<p>During the various sessions, and Open Spaces, there were a number of recommendations made.  These included blogs, podcasts, books, etc.  I have captured the ones that I could below.  If I have missed anything, or if there are any that you would like to add, please feel free to get in touch.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Today was the last day of DevWeek</h1>

<p>Well, it has been a long, but enjoyable, week at DevWeek, and today was the last day.  Today was another full day workshop, and I decided to attend the Continuous Delivery Workshop with Neal Ford.</p>

<p>People who have been following this series of posts will know that I have been rather lucky, winning both a Surface RT and a Telerik DevCraft Complete License.  There were no prizes won today, but you will all be happy to know that I have purchased a Euro Millions lottery ticket.  I will keep you posted on whether I win anything :-)</p>

<p>Review of the other days of DevWeek can be seen here:</p>

<li><p><a href="http://gep13.me/Y0Gj7A">Day 5 - Post-Conference Workshop</a> (this post)</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>Post-Conference Workshop at DevWeek</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Neal Ford (you can find his blog <a href="http://nealford.com/">here</a>, and his twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/neal4d">here</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Topic: </strong>Continuous Delivery Workshop</p>

<blockquote>Getting software released to users is often a painful, risky, and time-consuming process. This workshop sets out the principles and technical practices that enable rapid, incremental delivery of high quality, valuable new functionality to users.
Through automation of the build, deployment, and testing process, and improved collaboration between developers, testers and operations, delivery teams can get changes released in a matter of hours – sometimes even minutes – no matter what the size of a project or the complexity of its code base.
The workshop materials are derived from the best-selling book ‘Continuous Delivery’, and were created in collaboration with the authors and other of my ThoughtWorks colleagues.</blockquote>


<h1>Thoughts</h1>

<p>Overall, I have to say that this was a very well structured and executed presentation.  Neal obviously understands this area very well, and was able to field a number of questions from the audience.  There was loads of active conversation from the audience, which made it even more interesting.  Lots of conversation regarding real-life situations, and experiences.</p>

<p>The one thing that I thought was missing from the Workshop was some demos.  There was lots of description of the deployment pipeline, and using puppet to automate the configuration of a server, but I think what really would have cemented these ideas was an example.  Even if this was a simple website application being packaged, and deployed onto even a single server, at the click of a button.  This would have made for a very cool end demonstration to summarize the whole discussion.</p>

<h1>Takeaways</h1>

<p>There really was loads to think about in this talk.  Some of the stand out questions, takeaways were as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How often do you release to users?</p>

<ul>
<li>Correct answer of course is that you should be ready to release to users whenever they require it.  Software should always be in a deployable state.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>How long would it take your organisation to deploy a change that involves just one line of code?</p></li>
<li><p>Thinking about the above, can you do this in a repeatable fashion, that doesn&rsquo;t involve crazy amounts of over time?</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure there is a clear delineation between Unit Tests and Functional Tests, and run these as separate parts of your delivery pipeline</p></li>
<li><p>Features Toggles gives you an alternative to creating many Feature Branches, avoiding the problem of merging</p></li>
<li><p>Going Live should be just another deployment that you are already practiced at internally</p></li>
<li><p>You should strive of Continuous Integration of your Databases as well as code</p></li>
<li><p>Look to make use of Puppet and Chef to configure development and staging environments, and store the configuration within your source control</p></li>
<li><p>When implementing Continuous Delivery, first gather metrics of current state of deployment, i.e. lead times and cycle times, and then compare after implementing Continuous Delivery</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>Quotes</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>&ldquo;Melt down silly architectural barriers between different areas of the organisation&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;If it hurts&hellip; Do it more often!&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;Bring the pain forward&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;Rational ClearCase i the most hostile pice of software towards Agile Development&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;Git is one of my favourite tools&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;Avoid life in the knitted Castle&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;The biggest PITA around software updates is data migration and schema changes&rdquo;</p></li>

<h1>Overall Thoughts</h1>

<p>As I have said in my other posts, I have had a really good time at DevWeek, and I am happy to say that I have learnt a lot this week.  Hoping to be able to take back a lot of what I have learnt and start applying them at work.</p>

<p>Huge congratulations to the organisers of DevWeek, they did a great job, and a huge thanks to all the staff of the Barbican and the helpers at DevWeek!</p>

</ul>


<h1>First Morning Session</h1>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Brock Allen (you can find his blog <a href="http://brockallen.com/">here</a>, and twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/brocklallen">here</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Topic: </strong>Internals of security in ASP.NET</p>

<blockquote>Security is crucial for online applications. This session on security discusses the basics and then the internals of authentication and authorization in ASP.NET. We will discuss Windows and Forums authentication, how roles are assigned to the user and how to control authorization in both WebForms and MVC applications.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>As per Brock&rsquo;s talk yesterday, this was another very well executed presentation, detailing the fine details of how Security works in ASP.NET (both Windows and Forms Authentication).  This talk got down to the nitty-gritty of how things work, with lots of great insights that showed how depth of knowledge on the subject.  You could argue that some of the topics were &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that everyone does them.  It is only when they are laid out in detail as they were in this talk, that you start to think about what you need to do in your own applications.</p>

<p><strong>Takeaways</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>You can add certificates into Fiddler (which allows you to do &ldquo;man in the middle&rdquo; attacks on yourself</p></li>
<li><p>Encryption should not be used to store passwords, you should hash the password</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://brockallen.com/2012/09/02/think-twice-about-using-membershipprovider-and-simplemembership/">Think twice about using MembershipProvider (and SimpleMembership)</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/brockallen/BrockAllen.MembershipReboot">MembershipReboot</a> - open source alternative to the above</p></li>
<li><p>FormsAuthenticationModule - intercepts all requests, and does the authentication from the cookie that is sent with the request</p></li>
<li><p>If you are doing ajax calls, you can use the HttpContext.Response.SuppressFormsAuthenticationRedirect to prevent the default redirect that would happen (which is of little use in ajax call)</p></li>
<li><p>The Authorize Attribute can be used to secure on both Roles and Users</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Quotes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>&ldquo;If you are not doing SSL, you are not taking this serious!&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been gabbing and gabbing about authentication, what about authorization?&rdquo;</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>Rest of the day</h1>

<p>The final session of today was one on NoSQL (specifically MongoDB) and I was very interested in seeing this!  On reading the schedule for the other sessions, it was clear that Michael was doing three back to back sessions, that each built on top of each other, to complete a full application.  Essentially, another full day workshop.  As a result, I decided to attend all three of them.</p>

<p><strong>Presenter: </strong>Michael Kennedy (you can find his blog <a href="http://blog.michaelckennedy.net/">here</a>, and twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/mkennedy">here</a>)</p>

<p><strong>First Topic: </strong>Nine ways your next ASP.NET MVC project can be better</p>

<blockquote>So you’re ready to start that new and ambitious ASP.NET MVC project. Maybe you’re kicking off a new startup or just finally moving that old-and-crusty Web Forms project into the modern development world. Either way, this talk will give you some easy things you can do immediately after creating that new MVC project that you will thank yourself for as your project grows in complexity.
This talk will be based on my related blog post here: [http://bit.ly/QoCxnC](http://bit.ly/QoCxnC)
We’ll examine each piece of advice using live demos with Visual Studio and some external tools such as YSLOW. We’ll also look at how to “modernize” MVC 3 projects with best practices built into MVC 4 projects (CSS bundles, etc.).</blockquote>


<p><strong>Second Topic:</strong> Building rich input forms in ASP.NET MVC</p>

<blockquote>ASP.NET MVC has gained broad adoption over the last year. This is in part due to its clean and simple design. However, one aspect that newcomers typically get hung up on is building pages that accept user input in various manners. In this talk we will explore the powerful features of ASP.NET MVC that allow us to build rich forms that accept user input. We’ll begin by discussing the built-in HTML Helpers and Model Binding. Next we’ll add validation and show how we can do both client and server-side validation using DataAnnotations. We’ll see that sometimes using domain models as our form-bound objects doesn’t make sense and so we will cover more advanced scenarios using View Models. Finally, time permitting, we’ll see how client-side programming with JavaScript and jQuery can take this even further.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Third Topic:</strong> Applied NoSQL in .NET</p>

<blockquote>Perhaps you’ve heard about the next generation of databases roughly classified as NoSQL databases? These databases are generally much better than RDBMS at scaling, performance, and ease-of-development (e.g. in NoSQL the object-relational impedance mismatch usually disappears). Unfortunately, many talks on NoSQL are very academic and general. Not this one.
This session will introduce the ideas around the so-called NoSQL movement, and we’ll learn how to leverage MongoDB (a popular open source NoSQL db) to build .NET applications using LINQ as the data access language. We’ll build out a .NET application using LINQ and MongoDB in a series of interactive demos using Visual Studio 2012 and C#.</blockquote>


<p><strong>Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>Overall, this was a really good series of presentations.  Each one built on the last, and the end result was a complete sample application that shows how to create an ASP.NET MVC Application, using MongoDB as the back-end.  I have been told be Michael that both the sample code for the talks and the slides will be made available, so I will be keeping an eye out for those!</p>

<p>The final session, although the most interesting for me, was (in my opinion) a little rushed in terms of the code that was shown, and there were a couple of problems during the demos that meant there was a bit of jumping around in the code.  However, this was more than made up for in the question and answer session at the end of the talk, lots of great info here, especially the discussion between whether to use MongoDB or RavenDB.</p>

<p>Also, during the second session, there was quite a lot of banging noises coming from elsewhere in the Barbican Centre, which was a little off-putting.</p>

<p><strong>Takeaways</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Lots of great tips about how to improve the default ASP.NET MVC project.  Far too many to list here, but check out Michael&rsquo;s blog post linked above.</p></li>
<li><p>Suggestion to use <a href="http://usablica.github.com/front-end-frameworks/compare.html">front-end frameworks</a> for CSS</p></li>
<li><p>Make use of a <a href="http://www.cssreset.com">reset.css</a></p></li>
<li><p>Make use of the Get, Post, Redirect pattern</p></li>
<li><p>For server-side validation, use ModelState.IsValid</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.toptensoftware.com/markdowndeep/">MarkDownDeep</a> - very cool</p></li>
<li><p>MongoDB runs as a Windows Service</p></li>
<li><p>There are numerous Management Tools including:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>MongoVue</p></li>
<li><p>LinqPad</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Any changes to the &ldquo;schema&rdquo; of the objects, will require running a script on the existing database</p></li>
<li><p>In production, you should have at least two instances of MongoDB</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>Overall Thoughts</h1>

<p>Another busy, but highly enjoyable day at DevWeek.  Was also able to squeeze in a kick lunch meeting with Paul, Hadi, Matt, and Howard.  Was great to catch up with people I haven&rsquo;t seen in a while, as well as put faces to twitter names!</p>
