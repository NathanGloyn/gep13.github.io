Formed in June 2010, the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group (ADNUGUK) is a non-profit user group which aims to benefit software developers in and around the Aberdeen area.

Primarily, we aim to offer in person events which deal with the various aspects of .Net Development. The topics for these meetings are decided by the User Group Committee, however, if there is a particular area that you would like to see an event on, then please feel free to [get in touch with us](http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/contact/).

It is our hope that all events will be provided absolutely free, or at a very minimal cost. We are able to do this through the generous support of our [sponsors](http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/sponsors/), without whom this group would not exist.

## Background

While I was working in Canada, I attended a number of .Net User Group sessions in Calgary.  I thought they were a great idea, and something that I hadn’t heard of happening back here in the UK.  When I came back, I found that there were in fact lots of User Groups in the UK, unfortunately, there weren’t any in “close” vicinity to Aberdeen.  The closest that I could find were out of Glasgow, Edinburgh, and occasionally, Dundee.

Although, these events are not a million miles away, they are far enough way to make me stop and think about whether I could attend them.  Some further investigation led me to look into the idea of setting up my own .Net User Group.  At first I thought that this would be a HUGE amount of work, and be difficult to get off the ground, however…

This turned out to not be the case.  With the help of some like-minded people ([Chris Forbes](https://twitter.com/#!/@chris_e_forbes), [Graeme Humphrey](https://twitter.com/#!/@graemehumphrey), and Mark Griffiths, we were able to establish the [Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group](http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/), in quite a short space of time.  With the help of the community, we are hoping that this will grow from strength to strength.
