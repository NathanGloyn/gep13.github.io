My name is Gary Ewan Park and I work as a Senior Software Systems Engineer up here in Aberdeen.  If you want to get in touch with me, there are a number of ways of doing that.  You can find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/gep13), [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/people/Gary-Ewan-Park/671128676), [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/gary-park/13/898/301), [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/gep13), and over at [VB Forums](http://www.vbforums.com/member.php?u=53106), or you can send a comment/question through this [blog](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?page_id=38).

I first started coding at University, (well, I say coding but, what I mean of course is [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.co.uk/)), and at my first job I started using the wonderful VB6.  As time progressed, I moved onto VB.Net in Visual Studio 2003, and when I started using Visual Studio 2005 I made the switch to using C#.  This wasn’t because I didn’t “like” VB.Net, but as I started getting into Web Forms Development, I started seeing a lot of similarities in syntax between C# and JavaScript, and to me, it seemed to make more sense to use C#.  Now, I am happy to converse in either VB.Net or C#.  However, as I am always saying, it doesn't matter about the syntax of the language, it is an understanding of the Framework, and what it is you are trying to achieve, that is the important thing.

I graduated from the University of Aberdeen with a First Class Honours Degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering.  Looking back at the career that I have had, it strikes me that a Computer Science Degree might have served me better.  On the other hand though, I do think it helps to be able to know about the hardware side of things, so that you can know what the software is trying to control.

Today sees me developing using SharePoint, Silverlight, and ASP.Net in Visual Studio 2008/2010.  In my spare time (what little I have) I am looking into using ASP.Net MVC, and the new version of my [site](http://www.gep13.co.uk/) will use this (when I ever get round to finishing it).

My wife tells me that I am “always” on [VB Forums](http://www.vbforums.com/member.php?u=53106), but I like to think that this is a little bit of an exaggeration.  I have been a member over there since 2004, and in 2010 I was made the Moderator of the ASP.Net Forum.  I started out asking questions at the forum back when I was programming in VB6, but as time as progressed, I have found myself being able to attempt to answer more and more questions, so I like to try to help out where I can.  One thing that I would say is, don’t be fooled by the name of this Forum.  Although it’s roots are in VB6, it has a thriving community of .Net, Mobile, Web, Office, Games and Database Developers, so I would highly encourage you to come over and take a [look](http://www.vbforums.com/index.php).

Recently, I have also started reviewing technical articles for [developerFusion](http://www.developerfusion.com/).  I have a personal aim where I would also like to start writing technical articles myself, but due to time constants are other factors, I am not really in a position to do this just now.

For my sins, I am a self-confessed Microsoft Fan Boy.  I don’t know what else to say other than I think that the .Net Framework is a great platform to build on, and I really can’t get enough of it.  I am a certified Microsoft Developer, (you can see my certifications [here](https://www.mcpvirtualbusinesscard.com/VBCServer/gep13/profile)) and I am more than happy to talk at length about anything geek related, so if you have any questions, feel free to get in touch.

Outside of work I like to play 5-a-side football and golf.  I used to be an archer at University as well, but since graduating I haven’t done any.  This is something that I would like to get back into though.
